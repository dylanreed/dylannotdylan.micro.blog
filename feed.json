				"title": "SAVE EARLY, SAVE OFTEN: How I Turned My Blog Into a Sierra Game (And All the Ways It Went Wrong First)",
				"content_html": "<p>I grew up on Sierra games. King&rsquo;s Quest, Space Quest, Quest for Glory—if it had &ldquo;Quest&rdquo; in the title and VGA graphics, I was there. Those games taught me that peak visual design was achieved sometime around 1992 and everything since has been a lateral move at best.</p>\n<p>So when I decided to redesign my blog, naturally I thought: what if my website looked like a point-and-click adventure game? What if my cat Ramona wandered across the screen? What if there were multiple themes and weather effects and a Konami code easter egg?</p>\n<p>What could possibly go wrong?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/191463/2025/d4982dfd6a.gif\" alt=\"Diver Cat walking across the screen\"> ## The Diver Incident</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing about having ADHD and access to AI art tools: every idea feels like the best idea until it isn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>I started this project with a diver sprite. A little 96x96 pixel diver who would swim across the page. Made sense at the time—I went to commercial diving school, I have a connection to the ocean, it&rsquo;s thematic.</p>\n<p>Except it wasn&rsquo;t. It was weird. Why is there a diver on a fantasy cottage blog about my hobbies and medical adventures? I scaled him down to 48x48. Still weird. I tried different animations.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at Ramona sleeping on my desk and thought: oh. It should just be my cat.</p>\n<p>Forty-seven sprite animations later, Ramona now walks, runs, jumps, yawns, sleeps, cleans her face, and wakes up—all in 8 directions. The diver files still exist in the repo like a reminder of my hubris.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/191463/2025/8b524a937d.gif\" alt=\"Frank walking across the screen\"> ## The 336-File Reorganization Commit</p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re building something with <a href=\"https://claude.ai/claude-code\">Claude Code</a> and <a href=\"https://pixellab.ai\">Pixellab</a>, the assets accumulate fast. Really fast. At some point I had files everywhere—sprites mixed with headers, fantasy assets next to cyberpunk ones, and a naming convention that could charitably be described as &ldquo;vibes-based.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The commit message for the fix was just: &ldquo;Reorganize all assets into theme folders.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>336 files. One commit. The git diff was a nightmare.</p>\n<p>But now everything lives in tidy folders: <code>/fantasy/</code>, <code>/sci-fi/</code>, <code>/cyberpunk/</code>, <code>/cabin/</code>, <code>/underwater/</code>. Each with their own headers, sprites, backgrounds. It&rsquo;s beautiful. It only took me three days of chaos to get there.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/191463/2025/594450c1e8.gif\" alt=\"Jeff walking across the screen\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-png-problem\">The PNG Problem</h2>\n<p>You know what&rsquo;s heavy?

I was essentially asking visitors to download a small video game before they could read my posts about ankle surgery.</p>\n<p>The fix was simple: convert everything to WebP. The result was dramatic—cyberpunk dropped to 12MB, the whole theme package became manageable. The lesson was the same one I keep learning: the obvious solution is usually the right one, I just have to fail my way to it first.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/191463/2025/64dda96ed1.gif\" alt=\"Alien Cat walking across the screen\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"168-lines-of-css-attribute-selectors\">168 Lines of CSS Attribute Selectors</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets fun.

				"title": "My Dang Ol' Derelict Ankle",
				"content_html": "<p>At the beginning of October (one month ago almost to the day) I had surgery on my right ankle to repair some messed up ligaments. While I have had multiple knee surgeries they were all arthroscopic and I wouldn&rsquo;t consider them a major surgery. This ankle surgery was a knock you out, cut your foot open, and tighten that shit up kind of surgery. The surgery went great.</p>\n<p>The same cannot be said about the recovery.</p>\n<p>For twelve days after the surgery my foot was wrapped up from toe to knee with dressings. Built into the dressings was an liquid cooling ice pack thing. The instructions were to keep my foot up all the time, run the ice machine all the time, and to be very careful when getting around. During these twelve days I probably spent no more than thirty minutes not on the couch or in bed, no more than thirty minutes without the ice machine running. I felt like I had done a pretty good job.</p>\n<p>Day twelve dawned beautifully. I was going to get to go to the doctor&rsquo;s office, get my splint removed, sutures out, and start the next part of recovery. There was going to be a walking boot and some sort of instructions to increase the use of my ankle. Sarah had even offered me Chinese takeout as a milestone reward that evening. I was so pumped.</p>\n<p>We get to the cast room and the nice lady cuts off my splint and all the bandages, saving the magical water cooler thing, and then goes to get the doctor. When he arrived he looks at it and say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He explained that it was more swollen than they would have liked and the wound wasn&rsquo;t healing very well. Cool. He poked and prodded, hemmed and hawed, and removed every other staple. He recommended that I go to a hospital, specifically one that is about thirty minutes away from my house, to get some hyperbaric oxygen(HBO from here on out) treatment to help with the healing. This was the silver lining I decided to focus on. I love hyperbaric chambers and actually studied how to operate them when I was at commercial diving school.</p>\n<p>Hyperbaric chambers are magical devices that puts you under pressure breathing pure oxygen and it helps with healing and inflammation. The chambers I trained on at school were multi-place chambers that allowed for multiple people to be in the chamber at once and you breath through a mask to get your pure oxygen.

				"content_text": "At the beginning of October (one month ago almost to the day) I had surgery on my right ankle to repair some messed up ligaments. While I have had multiple knee surgeries they were all arthroscopic and I wouldn't consider them a major surgery. This ankle surgery was a knock you out, cut your foot open, and tighten that shit up kind of surgery. The surgery went great. \n\nThe same cannot be said about the recovery. \n\nFor twelve days after the surgery my foot was wrapped up from toe to knee with dressings. Built into the dressings was an liquid cooling ice pack thing. The instructions were to keep my foot up all the time, run the ice machine all the time, and to be very careful when getting around. During these twelve days I probably spent no more than thirty minutes not on the couch or in bed, no more than thirty minutes without the ice machine running. I felt like I had done a pretty good job. \n\nDay twelve dawned beautifully. I was going to get to go to the doctor's office, get my splint removed, sutures out, and start the next part of recovery. There was going to be a walking boot and some sort of instructions to increase the use of my ankle. Sarah had even offered me Chinese takeout as a milestone reward that evening. I was so pumped. \n\nWe get to the cast room and the nice lady cuts off my splint and all the bandages, saving the magical water cooler thing, and then goes to get the doctor. When he arrived he looks at it and say, \"I don't like that.\" \n\nHe explained that it was more swollen than they would have liked and the wound wasn't healing very well. Cool. He poked and prodded, hemmed and hawed, and removed every other staple. He recommended that I go to a hospital, specifically one that is about thirty minutes away from my house, to get some hyperbaric oxygen(HBO from here on out) treatment to help with the healing. This was the silver lining I decided to focus on. I love hyperbaric chambers and actually studied how to operate them when I was at commercial diving school. \n\nHyperbaric chambers are magical devices that puts you under pressure breathing pure oxygen and it helps with healing and inflammation. The chambers I trained on at school were multi-place chambers that allowed for multiple people to be in the chamber at once and you breath through a mask to get your pure oxygen. The chamber I would be in at the hospital is a magical acrylic tube that you go into by yourself that they pump full of oxygen as they pressurize the tube. \n\nWhile you are in the tube you can only wear the provided scrubs and can bring nothing in with you. You are provided with juice, water, a urinal, and a washcloth. Pretty bleak until they hand you the movie list. They had about 250 DVDs to choose from and since you are in there for two hours for each treatment you have a lot of time to watch movies. \n\nBefore I could start I had to go through their intake procedure which was like all intakes at medical places.

				"content_html": "<p>Granted in the grand scheme of time periods where I don&rsquo;t blog&hellip; this is pretty short.</p>\n<p>I was doing on of my favorite things today, cruising the adhd subreddit, and I cam across a post about how people with ADHD, like yours truly, don&rsquo;t do habits. They do streaks. This was like a lightbulb coming on inside my little brain. It made so much sense. I am really good at starting something, going hard at it, and then just stopping. For no reason.</p>\n<p>Now I know. I don&rsquo;t need to think about it in terms of building a habit, instead I need to work on increasing my streak. Now I just have to figure out how to get a streak going for things I don&rsquo;t like doing. But that is a problem for another day.</p>\n<p>While I was thinking about streaking <!-- raw HTML omitted -->snort <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my mind wondered to a weird thing my brain does. As is common with a lot of people with ADHD I am not always great at remembering things. Out of sight out of mind is very real for me. I don&rsquo;t put things away because then they are gone forever. I don&rsquo;t read text immediately because then the notification goes away (I did recently learn that you can mark things as unread in iOS, which has been a game changer for me), and I don&rsquo;t remember peoples names.</p>\n<p>This hasn&rsquo;t been a huge problem for me because I am charming AF and can usually fake my way through things. But it does make me feel bad. Not the names so much but other things about my friends. Birthdays are one that really bothers me, how do you ask someone who you have been friends with for 20+ years what their birthdate is? Especially when they always remember yours. It is a weird anxiety that I have but I just push it down (which is totally healthy and won&rsquo;t cause problems later). I know that I need to just ask people and then put it in a calendar, but then I have to remember to ask people.</p>\n<p>I have taken to thinking about my ADHD as having an outdated system that has a bad habit of installing updates, failing, and reverting to a previous back-up overwriting things I am supposed to remember.

				"content_text": "Granted in the grand scheme of time periods where I don't blog... this is pretty short. \n\nI was doing on of my favorite things today, cruising the adhd subreddit, and I cam across a post about how people with ADHD, like yours truly, don't do habits. They do streaks. This was like a lightbulb coming on inside my little brain. It made so much sense. I am really good at starting something, going hard at it, and then just stopping. For no reason. \n\nNow I know. I don't need to think about it in terms of building a habit, instead I need to work on increasing my streak. Now I just have to figure out how to get a streak going for things I don't like doing. But that is a problem for another day. \n\nWhile I was thinking about streaking <sub>snort </sub>my mind wondered to a weird thing my brain does. As is common with a lot of people with ADHD I am not always great at remembering things. Out of sight out of mind is very real for me. I don't put things away because then they are gone forever. I don't read text immediately because then the notification goes away (I did recently learn that you can mark things as unread in iOS, which has been a game changer for me), and I don't remember peoples names. \n\nThis hasn't been a huge problem for me because I am charming AF and can usually fake my way through things. But it does make me feel bad. Not the names so much but other things about my friends. Birthdays are one that really bothers me, how do you ask someone who you have been friends with for 20+ years what their birthdate is? Especially when they always remember yours. It is a weird anxiety that I have but I just push it down (which is totally healthy and won't cause problems later). I know that I need to just ask people and then put it in a calendar, but then I have to remember to ask people. \n\nI have taken to thinking about my ADHD as having an outdated system that has a bad habit of installing updates, failing, and reverting to a previous back-up overwriting things I am supposed to remember. I used to write things down a lot, but for some reason when I write it down it is out of my brain and unless I find where I wrote it down I won't remember it anyway. The one trick that works <sub>most</sub> of the time is telling Sarah to remind me. \n\nI think this works because the one person I never want to disappoint is Sarah. My brain doesn't remember that I asked her to remind me, it just knows that it is important and that Sarah is involved. So it writes that immediately in memory.

				"content_html": "<p>For the last couple years I have lived in the world of web3&hellip; which for the longest time I (and most people) referred to as NFTs. It is entirely possible that you have not heard of NFTs but it is much more likely that what you have heard has been overwhelmingly negative. Which is a bummer because the technology that makes these magic jpegs go is fascinating. Let&rsquo;s talk about it.</p>\n<p>Non Fungible Tokens, that is what NFT stands for, are unique tokens that exist on the blockchain. To break that down further, an NFT is a work of art that lives on a giant worldwide computer with a public record of ownership. To make it simpler, imagine purchasing a physical work of art from an artist you love and the purchasing of that art work is noted in public record. If you sell that artwork to someone else, that transfer gets recorded and the new owner is noted.</p>\n<p>I am not sure that makes any more sense.

				"content_text": "For the last couple years I have lived in the world of web3... which for the longest time I (and most people) referred to as NFTs. It is entirely possible that you have not heard of NFTs but it is much more likely that what you have heard has been overwhelmingly negative. Which is a bummer because the technology that makes these magic jpegs go is fascinating. Let's talk about it. \n\nNon Fungible Tokens, that is what NFT stands for, are unique tokens that exist on the blockchain. To break that down further, an NFT is a work of art that lives on a giant worldwide computer with a public record of ownership. To make it simpler, imagine purchasing a physical work of art from an artist you love and the purchasing of that art work is noted in public record. If you sell that artwork to someone else, that transfer gets recorded and the new owner is noted. \n\nI am not sure that makes any more sense. I have spent the last 18 months explaining NFTs to individuals and fortune 500 companies... and I am still not sure it always makes sense.

I probably won&rsquo;t, but I am developing the skills to do just that.</p>\n<p>What I need to do is figure out how to make my hobbies into a Voltron like hobby.

When I first made puppets about ten years ago I used inferior materials. The good stuff was to difficult to obtain and so I made do with what I had on hand. Now I can find amazing materials that take my puppets to the next level and they show up in a couple days. \n\nI have often thought that I should prioritize my hobbies. Pick the ones that are my favorite and focus on those. I have even read that focusing on multiple things makes you mediocre at all of the things. But I do it all for fun so who cares. Just like when I was entertaining I will be a Jack of All Trades, Master of None. \n\nIf you look at the list of hobbies that I work on and take out the games, you are left with a list that is all about visual story telling. Making puppets, making clothes, making music, drawing storyboards, and writing a story. If I would take the time, I could make a movie. I probably won't, but I am developing the skills to do just that. \n\nWhat I need to do is figure out how to make my hobbies into a Voltron like hobby. Combine them all into one super hobby. That would be so awesome. Or maybe I should just make a mascot costume.\n",

It is in much better shape than I thought it would be. As I read through it I could see that I had learned a lot in my last year of writing. Granted it isn't perfect but I think I will be able to fix it up quickly. It is also less epic than *Calliope and the Living Biologic*, so there is less continuity to fix. \n\n<h4>Books</h4>\n| ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/covers-small/steelheart-small.png)  |  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/covers-small/the-night-circus-small.png)|  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/covers-small/outcast-2-small.png)| \n|---|---|---|\n| [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385743572/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307744434/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/163215448X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dylanreed06-20) \n\nI didn't get as many books read as previous months.

I am having a lot of fun, but it seems like my time is disappearing. I think being on Adderall has made me so much more focused at work that I am forced to work on all my hobbies at home. Like a normal person. \n\nBeing on ADHD meds has really upped my productivity in some areas, but it has made other things more difficult. Writing ha become an interesting hobby because I am more likely to plan instead of just write by the seat of my pants. I am still learning the best way to do that. \n\n<h4>Projects</h4>\nThe Bow Tie Project was going great, but this last week I just didn't have time. I mean... I had time, I just did other things instead. This week I will get back on my game and get a tie made. \n\nMy brother in law got me Warhammer: Age of Sigmar for my birthday.

It was about the characters and the world they are in.

I am pretty sure that my brain is just being a butthead and dreaming about not sleeping. What a creep!!\n\nI am still in love with the ukulele. It is so much fun to play and I find it calming. There are some chords that are stupid and hard to play but I am learning. It seems to be the chords that use all four of my fingers that give me the most trouble. My secret joy is scales. I love playing them, gradually speeding up and then BAM!! warp speed. \n\nMy writing schedule is going well. I have loaded myself up with lots of different projects, which is great. But... I am not always good at staying on task. Currently I am rewriting Calliope and the Living Biologic, first edits of Rio Borealis, and planning The Problem with Portal Five. The nice thing about this schedule is that it allows me to practice many different parts of writing that I am not very good at. \n\nDon't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)\n",

Which was surprising to no-one who has spent anytime with me. I have been given adderall to try and see how it helps with my symptoms. SO... if I seem less scattered maybe that is a good thing. Hopefully it doesn't bring out an underlying psychosis. Fingers crossed.\n\nAlso, we have been watching Buffy, and if you haven't stop reading now. We just got to the episode where Buffy's mom dies. AND WHAT THE FUCK!! I am not prepared to deal with this kind of shit. I don't want to cry into my hot dog and french fries but I will. \n\nI do not know if I am emotionally equipped for this right now, but luckily we are also watching Angel and he will most likely get to punch people. \n\nDon't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)\n",

I went into this book thinking that it would be Dexter but with a kid. \n\nAnd Dan Wells makes you think that for half the book. Then it gets crazy and the rest of the book is fantastic. There is a point in the book when I exclaimed, \"Shit!\" out loud, and I love having that kind of reaction. \n\nDon't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)\n",

I am trying to finish a novella that doesn't want to be finished. The problem is that I didn't plan out very well and am having a problem getting to the end. I know where the end is, but I don't know if I can get there. I am also debating just killing the whole thing and putting it in the idea recycler. \n\nThe Correspondent is going strong. I have a lot planned out and I am writing about a month ahead. Yay for being ahead. \n\nEditing Calliope and the Living Biologic and Rio Borealis is going slow. I am not a very motivated editor and I need to spend some time focusing on them both in March. \n\n<h4>Books</h4>\n\n![February Books](https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/6af298fff3.jpg)\n\nI read fewer books, but I read longer books. Kind of. Actually only one was incredibly long, but they were all good. I am now ahead of my reading goal for the year, which means I can focus more energy on other projects and not worry about falling behind. \n\n<h4>Life</h4>\nI am another year older now. Or at least that is what my birthday told me. One of the best parts about getting older is that your body starts to do weird things. Like pooping blood. Read all about it [here](https://medium.com/@dylanreed/the-time-i-pooped-blood-599c9cbe0432#.o6azwx7et). It hasn't been horrible but my brain can't stop assuming that it will be something horrible. \n\n<h4>Projects</h4>\nThe Bow Tie Project is going great. I think I have perfected my patterns and am starting to pick up some speed while making a tie. I am working ahead so that when I lose steam I won't run out of bow ties. It is also time to start making bow ties for other people. Here is the [form](http://dylan.la/2j1ogU3) if you are interested in getting one. \n\nHarper got me a subscription to sketchbox for my birthday. This will force me to draw more and to play with other mediums besides just pencil. I also got colored leads for my Kweco lead holder so that will add some fun to my pencil drawing.  \n\nAnd, because I needed something else to do, I started learning to play the Ukulele.

But I never bit the bullet and bought a banjo and started to learn.</p>\n<p>I think it had a lot to do with not wanting to spend money on something that my ADHD brain might give up on before getting started. So that was added onto the pile of things I wanted to learn but haven&rsquo;t taken the time to learn.</p>\n<p>As I was driving around on Saturday I remembered that my mom had a Ukulele.

Well...a stressful week. I have been dealing with things in my own way. \n\nI just finished The Name of the Wind. It is just as good as everyone told me it would be. It was a good book to have while dealing with feelings, since it allowed me to escape into the world of Kvothe. \n\nRecently I decided that I should learn to play an instrument. A stringed instrument to be exact. Many moons ago I wanted to learn how to play the Banjo. But I never bit the bullet and bought a banjo and started to learn. \n\nI think it had a lot to do with not wanting to spend money on something that my ADHD brain might give up on before getting started. So that was added onto the pile of things I wanted to learn but haven't taken the time to learn. \n\nAs I was driving around on Saturday I remembered that my mom had a Ukulele. That would be perfect. Sure it isn't a mandolin or banjo, but it is an instrument you strum with strings. This makes it a perfect place for me to get my feet wet without having to spend a lot of money. \n\nI have started practicing and learning chords. I am not 100% on the process of learning a musical instrument or how playing the piano\\tuba years ago will hope, so it is a wait and see how it goes. \n\nAlso this [happened](https://twitter.com/i/moments/829833295240232960).\n\n\nDon't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)\n",

Enough blood to make me concerned. The water wasn’t a bright red, but it wasn’t a pastel pink either.</p>\n<p name=\"2b99\" id=\"2b99\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I have had hemorrhoids in the past. And like all things that have to do with your butt, they are not to be spoken of. It is not a good conversation starter, “Hey, I have hemorrhoids.” All because it is on your butt.</p>\n<p name=\"6435\" id=\"6435\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Hemorrhoids, those nasty little butt hole pimples, sometimes burst. When they burst you will find blood on your wiping material of choice. It is like a cat scratch worth of blood. Nothing to worry about, but can be a surprise. As an added bonus, it will now itch the rest of the day.</p>\n<p name=\"5e82\" id=\"5e82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But this time, the amount of blood I saw was not on the wiping material, but instead all over the bowl of the toilet. It had splattered and splashed and was disgusting. My first reaction was “What!?!” followed by a more calm, “ What the actual fuck is happening?” Immediately I made doctor’s appointment.</p>\n<p name=\"c808\" id=\"c808\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When I texted Sarah about it, which is a normal thing to text to your spouse, she asked, “Did you check for ketchup packets under the seat?” Because that is the best\\worst practical joke. I had checked. Not ketchup.</p>\n<p name=\"85dc\" id=\"85dc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The next day when I went to the doctor’s office to get checked out, I assumed that it wasn’t going to be fun. I had already been playing through the worst case scenarios, which in my mind involved a stranger examining my butt hole. I mean that is the worst that could happen, right?</p>\n<p name=\"f60c\" id=\"f60c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They weighed me, I was please to learn that I was wearing eight pounds of clothes, asked me for my height, and sat me in a room. They asked me all sorts of questions about drugs, tobacco and allergies. Then we got to the fun question.</p>\n<p name=\"b924\" id=\"b924\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“What brings you in today?”</p>\n<p name=\"d5b2\" id=\"d5b2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had already told the lady on the phone, the receptionist, and they apparently hadn’t written it down. Do a lot of people lie about rectal bleeding to get the free finger up the butt? Internally I rolled my eyes and explained the situation.</p>\n<p name=\"3d01\" id=\"3d01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">He was very polite about the whole thing. After taking my blood pressure and temperature, he left me waiting for the doctor to come in.</p>\n<p name=\"1472\" id=\"1472\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I waited.</p>\n<p name=\"1ca1\" id=\"1ca1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And waited.</p>\n<p name=\"1e41\" id=\"1e41\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Eventually there was a knock at the door and in walked the doctor. This was a new doctor to me, because I am bad at going to the doctor. Not anything against doctors, but I don’t go unless I feel bad. Which Rebecca the Receptionist told me was a bad idea.</p>\n<p name=\"0e1e\" id=\"0e1e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The doc was a nice lady, dark hair shot with grey. She sat down on the rolling stool and started asking me questions. Diet, family history, all that jazz. Then we got to the question of the day.</p>\n<p name=\"1766\" id=\"1766\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“What brings you in today?”</p>\n<p name=\"5e4e\" id=\"5e4e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sighing, I explained everything again. She asked more specific questions and then said the words that everyone wants to hear at the doctors office.</p>\n<p name=\"787f\" id=\"787f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“You know I am going to have to do a rectal exam.”</p>\n<p name=\"41e5\" id=\"41e5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Not a question, but a statement of fact. The only way to get to the bottom of things was to dig in and figure it out. All I could think was a very confused “Yay.”</p>\n<p name=\"7841\" id=\"7841\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Because I am me I said, “Only if you buy me dinner first.”</p>\n<p name=\"d00f\" id=\"d00f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And too my surprise she started to laugh. Not the indulgent laugh of the ticket taker at a movie theater who says “Enjoy your show,” and you say “You too.” But a belly laugh of someone who understands the situation fully.</p>\n<p name=\"0829\" id=\"0829\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After we finished laughing it was back to business. She handed me a thin paper sheet and stepped out of the room. This being my first rectal exam I dropped my pants and laid on my stomach on the table.</p>\n<p name=\"088c\" id=\"088c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When she came back in she took one look at me and laughed again. She had me roll over on one side and took up her position near my butt. I heard the squish sound as she squeezed lube onto her gloved hand and prepared myself.</p>\n<p name=\"bd9e\" id=\"bd9e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How does one prepare for a rectal exam? All I could think about was that instead of the dinner joke I should have gone with the, “But I haven’t studied,” joke. I cleared my mind. I went to my happy place. I took deep breathes.</p>\n<p name=\"34d8\" id=\"34d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And then I was pulled back into the present.</p>\n<p name=\"65f6\" id=\"65f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">After she was done she threw the glove away and left giving me a chance to get dressed. When she came back in she explained that she hadn’t found anything that would explain the blood. And that I would probably need to get a colonoscopy done.</p>\n<p name=\"6830\" id=\"6830\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yay.</p>\n<p name=\"ae9f\" id=\"ae9f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Until then I just need to be careful and not poop out too much blood. So I am trying that out.</p>\n<p name=\"2222\" id=\"2222\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">To be </strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@dylanreed/i-dont-think-the-camera-is-supposed-to-go-there-4e8dd822a7ee\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@dylanreed/i-dont-think-the-camera-is-supposed-to-go-there-4e8dd822a7ee\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">continued</strong></a><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">…</strong></p>\n<p name=\"cc0c\" id=\"cc0c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><a href=\"http://dylanreed.com\" data-href=\"http://dylanreed.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dylan Reed</a> has always been interested in a good story.

Reduced to only tens of thousands by a weaponized virus to which only a fraction of humanity is immune, the survivors in North America have huddled together on Long Island. But sixteen-year-old Kira is determined to find a solution. As she tries desperately to save what is left of her race, she discovers that that the survival of both humans and Partials rests in her attempts to answer questions about the war's origin that she never knew to ask.\n\n<h4>Review</h4>\n\nI have read a lot of YA dystopian books. I mean, who hasn't? This one has a lot going for it in the positive section: it takes place in a real place, the main character has flaws, and the other characters are fun as well. \n\nThe point that you enter the story is great and you are led along as they try to survive. The stakes are end of the world high and unlike other YA books I have read recently this one feels like they could fail at any moment. I tore thru this book quickly and really want to read the next book. \n\n\nDon't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)\n",

				"content_text": "![Ramona on her yellow footstool.](https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/877d642b1e.jpg)\n\n<h4>Writing</h4>\nThis month started out super well for writing. I started the next series on [Acme Hero Inc.](http://acmeheroinc.com) I also started editing Calliope (hopefully for the final time). My Nano book for 2016 has been sitting unread for the last two months. TWO MONTHS!!! and I haven't touched it. It has been a struggle and I am thinking that I am going to try and make it until March before I read it. \n\n<h4>Books</h4>\n![January Books](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dylanreed/dylan.blog/gh-pages/images/monthly-blog/jan-books.png)\n\nI am seven books through my sixty book yearly goal. \n\n<h4>Life</h4>\n2017 started out so well. I mean, aside from the whole Trump thing, things were looking up. My coworker was back from maternity leave and work was getting more fun. \n\nBut then my dad got sick. An infection that spread forcing him to endure multiple surgeries and wound care. Needless to say this kicked my ass. I have been known to be emotional and when someone I love is injured or sick I do not handle it well. \n\nMy dad getting sick got me thinking about when Sarah was sick and what a hard time I had dealing with that. It drug up a lot of emotions and stopped me from producing. I wasn't writing or sewing, just sitting around. \n\n<h4>Projects</h4>\nThe Bow Tie Project is going great. I am still enjoying making bow ties and am learning a lot about how to make them. There are so many fabrics I am looking forward to making and I can't wait to share them with you here. \n\nAnd drawing is back. I started doodling during inktober and have remembered how much I love drawing. And because I don't have enough projects going I think I will start posting more of my drawings. \n\nI have also started blogging a lot more.

The transition was not as smooth as it could have been, but now that I have learned the tricks and what not, it is a lot easier. \n\nAnyhoo.\n\nThis week has been a mix of crazy and fun. I started making curtains for our guest bedroom, as well as sewing a bow tie (or two). The curtains are almost difficult to sew because they are so big compared to the bow ties.\n\nMy reading goal of sixty books this year is going well. I finished book four yesterday and started book five. I got volume 12 of *CHEW* as well. I am conflicted because I have a list of books I want to read this year and  *CHEW* isn't on it. And since it is the last book in the series I want to reread all of them first. \n\nInstead I will be responsible and follow my list. If I get my five books done in the month, then I can start reading *CHEW*. That way I can stay on track and also read what I want. \n\nI also found one of my old projects for a text based adventure. So now that is distracting me from my writing... or maybe I am just lazy.\n\nDon't forget that you can support my writing efforts on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dylanreed)\n",

Going through what I had written, I removed some things, but otherwise left the manuscript unchanged.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Harper, I was able to get in contact with a couple authors as well as an agent.

After my discussions I decided that rushing the release would kill the book and I didn’t want to do that. So I shifted focus.</p>\n<p>I read Calliope again. And made lots of notes.

				"content_text": "<h2>Maybe?</h2>\nI have been busy writing and rewriting, so blogging has taken a backseat. I want to blog more but if I am going to let one form of writing slip it will be blogging. Fiction writing is much more personally rewarding and I enjoy doing it so much that it is hard for me to justify writing random thoughts down when I can instead move a story along. \n\nYou may remember my [NaNoWriMo](http://fancycadaver.com/2015/12/04/fiction/) triumph. I was excited because I had written my first novel. I was pleased with it, I let people read it and received positive feedback. Going through what I had written, I removed some things, but otherwise left the manuscript unchanged. \n\nThanks to Harper, I was able to get in contact with a couple authors as well as an agent. Through these connections I learned a very important lesson. Writing is easy, rewriting is hard. \n\nI had been planning on releasing <i>Calliope and the Rogue Biologic</i> for the Kindle on April 1st. After my discussions I decided that rushing the release would kill the book and I didn’t want to do that. So I shifted focus. \n\nI read Calliope again. And made lots of notes. I studied story structure and plotting. I outlined my entire novel and laid it out in scrivener. I then went through my original manuscript and found where I could plug in the scenes that I loved. \n\nCamp NaNoWriMo happened in April and that is when I decided to rock out my rewrites. The concrete goal of finishing by the end of April help motivate me and was a positive step forward. \n\nAnd guess what? My story is better. I found an editor who I am actually paying to edit my manuscript to make it as perfect as possible (and you can help [pay](http://dylan.la/1VKl5gF) for it). I now spend my time waiting on the edits to comeback and am reading a lot of new books. \n\nPart of my writing practice has been [The Correspondent](http://acmeheroinc.com). This project started out years ago when I wanted to write a superhero story. I had almost an entire notebook full of ideas of what I wanted to happen but felt that I would never complete such a large project. \nI even attempted to do it a while ago and failed. \n\nThis attempt has gone a lot better. I built up a buffer of posts )and set them to auto-publish. Once I finished the first arc I edited it and have put it on [Amazon](http://dylan.la/1SaT8L4) so you can read the whole Origin on your kindle. \n\nReading the early posts vs. the more current ones is interesting because my writing ability has grown. \n\nIn fact, I should be writing the next episode of The Correspondent right not… But I am suffering from a little bit of fiction burnout. I pushed so hard finishing the rewrites that I am now unable to think in terms of story. It is pretty sad. \nHere is hoping that I start blogging more often and with more interesting things. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nIf you want to support me on [Patreon](http://dylan.la/23JgCMg) you can!!\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In a lot of way 2014 sucked. The first part of the year specifically. We had a fun Christmas 2013 in Chicago and then when we arrived home we noticed that Thomas was acting weird/skinny/not eating. We took him to the vet and turned out he had fatty liver. So we fought that. Feeding tubes and cash seemed to help that problem. We took him to the vet to have the feeding tube remove and get the trouble making teeth pulled and everything was good. Or so we thought.</p>\n<p>We thought wrong. Turns out that Thomas had gained some cancer during everything else. He was going to die. They could give us treatments that would maybe give him another year but there wasn&rsquo;t anything that was going to bring him back. It was over and we were broken. We chose to save Thomas the pain of cancer and had him put to sleep. It sucked more than I have been able to express. It wasn&rsquo;t the end of the world but it felt like it.</p>\n<p>Then Ramona happened. She is the greatest kitty we could ask for and has done amazing things to the healing that Sarah and I both needed. She snuggles with us and is silly all the time. And it shows us that everything happens for a reason. I am so thankful for Sarah being supportive of my want of a purebred cat and also for reminding me about Winston and the amazingness that is exotic shorthairs. This was the beginning of the awesome six months of 2014.</p>\n<p>Sarah and I celebrated 10 years of marriage in September continuing our streak of kicking marriages ass. Sarah is still my best friend and I am lucky to wake up next to her every morning and go to sleep next to her every night.

				"content_text": "\nIn a lot of way 2014 sucked. The first part of the year specifically. We had a fun Christmas 2013 in Chicago and then when we arrived home we noticed that Thomas was acting weird/skinny/not eating. We took him to the vet and turned out he had fatty liver. So we fought that. Feeding tubes and cash seemed to help that problem. We took him to the vet to have the feeding tube remove and get the trouble making teeth pulled and everything was good. Or so we thought. \n\nWe thought wrong. Turns out that Thomas had gained some cancer during everything else. He was going to die. They could give us treatments that would maybe give him another year but there wasn't anything that was going to bring him back. It was over and we were broken. We chose to save Thomas the pain of cancer and had him put to sleep. It sucked more than I have been able to express. It wasn't the end of the world but it felt like it. \n\nThen Ramona happened. She is the greatest kitty we could ask for and has done amazing things to the healing that Sarah and I both needed. She snuggles with us and is silly all the time. And it shows us that everything happens for a reason. I am so thankful for Sarah being supportive of my want of a purebred cat and also for reminding me about Winston and the amazingness that is exotic shorthairs. This was the beginning of the awesome six months of 2014.\n\nSarah and I celebrated 10 years of marriage in September continuing our streak of kicking marriages ass. Sarah is still my best friend and I am lucky to wake up next to her every morning and go to sleep next to her every night. She supports me in everything I want to do and I try my darndest to do the same. Also today is the 15th year anniversary of our first date because we are awesome. \n\nIn October I started a new job as a Life Enrichment Coordinator at an assisted living facility. It is awesome.

This led me to be a lover of all animals.</p>\n<p>When I was eighteen I decided I wanted a dog of my own. I had gotten a cat of my own when I was sixteen and wanted to add a dog to my collection. Dogs and cats were a part of my family for as long as I can remember. The first dogs I remember were two shetland sheepdogs(I think) name Roxanne and Trinket. Aside from being really nice dogs they also had the best names for a pair of dogs ever. When I decide I want something I tend to research the shit out of it and decide what I want.</p>\n<p>As such I researched all sorts of different types of dogs. Border collies, bearded collies, Jack Russell Terriers and Newfoundlands topped the list. But there were many dogs I would have loved to have had. But I was never in a place to get a dog. When Sarah and I moved in together I would have loved to have gotten a dog, but it wasn&rsquo;t my house and so we got Thomas. Thomas was amazing. Greatest cat ever. He reminded me why I love cats.</p>\n<p>He was goofy and graceful, playful and aloof, and above all he was a love. The thing with cats is that if they love you you have made it. You have earned the love of something that could really care less about you. Thomas loved me. And I loved him.</p>\n<p>One of the things that Sarah always said was that the Inn was full. Meaning that we already had too many animals in the house and didn&rsquo;t have room for more. Which is a valid point. Three animals plus two humans is more then enough. When Sarah and I moved our families started to talk about how we should get a dog. We had a yard and room for another animal. Sarah and I talked about it.</p>\n<p>We felt it was unfair of us to bring another being into our house that would take our time away from our cats. Also it would be unfair to inflict our schedules on a dog. But we talked about it.</p>\n<p>Then we lost Thomas.</p>\n<p>Suddenly our world turned upside down. A huge part of our lives was gone forever. We knew we could never replace Thomas nor did we want to. Again we talked about getting a dog. I think Sarah would have happily bought me any dog I wanted just to end the pain I was in. I think that she was preparing herself to the reality that is a puppy, thinking that when the time came to get another animal, to fill the vacancy, we would get a dog.</p>\n<p>There was an emptiness in our house. We had two wonderful cats, Reno and Beda, but the light seemed to have gone out of our house. We were sad all the time. I started working crazy hours to spend less time alone in the house. We talked about getting another animal. As I thought more about it I realized something.</p>\n<p>I like dogs, but I love Cats.</p>\n<p>When I mentioned this to Sarah I think she was a little surprised. I have talked about getting a dog for a long time. Probably the entire time we have been together. And yet when given the opportunity to get a dog, I chose to look at cats.</p>\n<p>Every cat I have ever been around has been a domestic short hair, which is cat for mutt. They have all been wonderful. Sure Rascal and Ed were mean, Zeppelin was silly and Scooter was completely insane; but they were also the most interesting creatures I had ever been around.

Maybe it was because of all of the diffeerent types of purebred cat or maybe it is because I have never had one before. But I wanted one.</p>\n<p>Before I got Scooter I had thought of getting a purebred cat. I was sixteen and had no money so I couldn&rsquo;t but I had researched the crap out of cat breeds. Personally I was a fan of the Cornish Rex. Cornish Rexes have curly short hair, feel like velvet and love to play. They are basically little dogs. I also love all of the big cats: Maine Coons, Norwegian Mountain Cats, etc. Talking to Sarah she had one breed she loved: Exotic Shorthairs.</p>\n<p>Looking at exotic shorthairs you can&rsquo;t help but fall in love with them. They are a short hair persian. All the personality and squishy face, none of the long hair and genetic problems. They are super cute.</p>\n<p>Having looked at them and research them I took to the internet to find a breeder. I was hopeful to find one in Colorado and as luck would have it I did. I was checking out the website and I noticed they had a kitten available. I sent it to Sarah and she was curious. I called the lady and asked about the kitten.

				"content_html": "<p>In my current job I get argued with quite a bit. As a professional people person I have picked up a few tricks that allow me to not win every time but to not lose. The problem with arguing in general is that it gets nothing done.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Arguing kills productivity</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is what you can do to prevent this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t argue to win: Even if you know you are right winning is never the goal of arguing. Keep in mind that as much as you think you are right the other person feels the same way. If winning is all the matters you aren&rsquo;t going to listen to what the other person is saying.</li>\n<li>Listen: This one should be a no-brainer but if you are so consumed with winning you won&rsquo;t be listening to what the other person is saying. You will be focusing your energy on what you are going to say next not on understanding their point of view.</li>\n<li>Write stuff down: If you right down their points as they state them you can take time when they are done talking to form your response. This also slows down the pace of the argument allowing both sides to keep cool.</li>\n<li>Keep your voice down: If you yell they win. You lose all your credibility if you start yelling. Also if they start yelling step back and figure out what is causing them to get angry and give them a chance to clam down before continuing.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t repeat your position more then twice: It they don&rsquo;t get it by the second time they aren&rsquo;t going to get it. Repeating your self does not make you right.</li>\n<li>Compromise: This is what you need to do. If you are unable to compromise on a position make that clear from the start. It is pointless to argue about something that there is no way to change.</li>\n<li>Stay on topic: If you are pissed about the quality of your movie pop-corn talk about that. Don&rsquo;t suddenly switch gears about the lack of bubbles in your soda. It is just confusing and makes you look like you don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t be tricky: There are a lot of tricks you can use to establish dominance in a conversation.

				"content_text": "\nIn my current job I get argued with quite a bit. As a professional people person I have picked up a few tricks that allow me to not win every time but to not lose. The problem with arguing in general is that it gets nothing done.\n\n> Arguing kills productivity\n\n  \nHere is what you can do to prevent this:\n\n  1. Don't argue to win: Even if you know you are right winning is never the goal of arguing. Keep in mind that as much as you think you are right the other person feels the same way. If winning is all the matters you aren't going to listen to what the other person is saying.\n  2. Listen: This one should be a no-brainer but if you are so consumed with winning you won't be listening to what the other person is saying. You will be focusing your energy on what you are going to say next not on understanding their point of view.\n  3. Write stuff down: If you right down their points as they state them you can take time when they are done talking to form your response. This also slows down the pace of the argument allowing both sides to keep cool.\n  4. Keep your voice down: If you yell they win. You lose all your credibility if you start yelling. Also if they start yelling step back and figure out what is causing them to get angry and give them a chance to clam down before continuing.\n  5. Don't repeat your position more then twice: It they don't get it by the second time they aren't going to get it. Repeating your self does not make you right.\n  6. Compromise: This is what you need to do. If you are unable to compromise on a position make that clear from the start. It is pointless to argue about something that there is no way to change.\n  7. Stay on topic: If you are pissed about the quality of your movie pop-corn talk about that. Don't suddenly switch gears about the lack of bubbles in your soda. It is just confusing and makes you look like you don't know what you are talking about.\n  8. Don't be tricky: There are a lot of tricks you can use to establish dominance in a conversation. Don't use them. They may work but you are too focused on tricks. State your facts clearly and be able to answer questions about them for the other party.\n  \n\n\n  \nI have spent a lot of time studying people and their mannerisms. These are common tricks people try to use to get their way:\n\n  * The Steepler: This person steeples there hands in front of their chest or on the table. They are used to winning and feel supremely confident in their position. To counter act mirror what they are doing. This will make shake their confidence and bring them back to the table for an actual discussion.\n  * Big Eyebrows: This person raises their eyebrows to their hairline to show how serious they are. This is a method of establishing dominance in the conversation. Don't let them take charge. Acknowledge the seriousness of the topic but make your points clear.\n  * Arm Crosser: Leaning back with their arms crossed is a sign that they are done listening and are not going to budge. End the conversation. These people are done or at the very least they think they are. If you tell them that you will talk to them when they are willing to listen they may rejoin the conversation.\n  * The Interrupter: Refusing to let you speak will allow your frustration to get the better of you allowing them to win. Let them know that if they continue to interrupt you will end the conversation. Be aware these people will accuse you of interrupting them any chance they get.\n  * The Subject Changer: This person dances around to a lot of subjects very quickly. Help keep them focused by saying \"Lets talk about X and then we can talk about Y.\" If they still can't stay focused write down all the topics they bring up and keep bringing them back to the topic at hand.\n  \n\n\n  \nIf you bring this knowledge to all your arguments you will be ready when you encounter these argument tactics.

				"content_html": "<p>Sarah and I recently moved into a new home. It is a nice gigantic home that will allow us to put in studio space as well as have room to get 30 or 40 more cats. When we were getting ready to move Harper got really excited and sent us all sorts of neat things to make our home more automated.</p>\n<p>As I played with these automation devices I realized that I don&rsquo;t need a lot of things automated. Or I realized the things I want automated are not available for the single family home of a middle class family.</p>\n<p>Here is what I have tried out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LifX bulbs - Color changing fancy light bulbs</li>\n<li>Phillips Hue - Color changing fancy light bulbs</li>\n<li>SmartThings - Used for automating and tracking</li>\n<li>Sonos - Music</li>\n<li>Nest - Thermostat taken to the next level</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of those aren&rsquo;t automation but they put me in the same frame of mind: Making the <strong>HOME OF THE FUTURE!!!</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"what-worked\">What worked</h1>\n<p><em>or what worked for me.</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"bulbs\">Bulbs</h4>\n<p>Both bulbs work great. The LifX bulbs where easy to set up and don&rsquo;t have a hub so don&rsquo;t take up a spot on your router. The iOS app is well made and works. Response time between your phone and the bulbs is quick. I did experience a time when it would lose connection and I would have to restart the app to get them to work.</p>\n<p>I like the LifX bulbs because they remember settings. If I set it one way and then shut off the switch when I turn it on it will be the same color/brightness it was when I turned it off.</p>\n<p>The Hue bulbs worked well and considering that the setup was more complex it wasn&rsquo;t difficult. Plug in hub, screw in bulbs, open app and push the button on the hub. The problem is that we are energy conscious and having to open up an app to turn off the lights was a pain. When you flip the switch off and then back on they return to the default white.</p>\n<p>Where they shine is in the app. The ability to design color schemes based on a picture is a neat feature and makes creating a new theme a snap. Also the ability to link bulbs and adjust until you are happy with it is nice.</p>\n<p>I have had more problems with my Hue bulbs then the LifX ones. I had to change out my router and in doing so craziness happened. The Hue app wouldn&rsquo;t work even after quitting it and resetting my phone. It just started to work again but it was a frustrating week.</p>\n<p>When it comes to fancy color changing lights I would recommend the Hue bulbs. The presentation is slicker and they support a ton of bulbs. But, I don&rsquo;t feel the need to have different colored lights. The auto-off/auto-on features can be nice but I am not so lazy I cannot use my fingers for that.</p>\n<h4 id=\"smartthings\">SmartThings</h4>\n<p>SmartThings are cool. Not super useful but cool.

				"content_text": "\nSarah and I recently moved into a new home. It is a nice gigantic home that will allow us to put in studio space as well as have room to get 30 or 40 more cats. When we were getting ready to move Harper got really excited and sent us all sorts of neat things to make our home more automated.\n\nAs I played with these automation devices I realized that I don't need a lot of things automated. Or I realized the things I want automated are not available for the single family home of a middle class family.\n\nHere is what I have tried out:\n\n  * LifX bulbs - Color changing fancy light bulbs\n  * Phillips Hue - Color changing fancy light bulbs\n  * SmartThings - Used for automating and tracking\n  * Sonos - Music\n  * Nest - Thermostat taken to the next level\n  \n\n\n  \nSome of those aren't automation but they put me in the same frame of mind: Making the **HOME OF THE FUTURE!!!**\n\n# What worked\n\n  \n_or what worked for me._\n\n#### Bulbs\n\n  \nBoth bulbs work great. The LifX bulbs where easy to set up and don't have a hub so don't take up a spot on your router. The iOS app is well made and works. Response time between your phone and the bulbs is quick. I did experience a time when it would lose connection and I would have to restart the app to get them to work.\n\nI like the LifX bulbs because they remember settings. If I set it one way and then shut off the switch when I turn it on it will be the same color/brightness it was when I turned it off.\n\nThe Hue bulbs worked well and considering that the setup was more complex it wasn't difficult. Plug in hub, screw in bulbs, open app and push the button on the hub. The problem is that we are energy conscious and having to open up an app to turn off the lights was a pain. When you flip the switch off and then back on they return to the default white.\n\nWhere they shine is in the app. The ability to design color schemes based on a picture is a neat feature and makes creating a new theme a snap. Also the ability to link bulbs and adjust until you are happy with it is nice.\n\nI have had more problems with my Hue bulbs then the LifX ones. I had to change out my router and in doing so craziness happened. The Hue app wouldn't work even after quitting it and resetting my phone. It just started to work again but it was a frustrating week.\n\nWhen it comes to fancy color changing lights I would recommend the Hue bulbs. The presentation is slicker and they support a ton of bulbs. But, I don't feel the need to have different colored lights. The auto-off/auto-on features can be nice but I am not so lazy I cannot use my fingers for that.\n\n#### SmartThings\n\n  \nSmartThings are cool. Not super useful but cool. I set them up once we moved in and did not find the options to be useful. There was a lot of neat potential but I found the execution to be lacking. Part of that could have been me.\n\nThe SmartThings app is a pain to use. I found that it was counter-intuitive for a lot of things and didn't update as fast as I wanted.\n\nThe one thing I wanted to be able to do with my SmartThings was tell if my garage door is open or closed. I couldn't get the magnetic sensors to work in a way that made sense so I ended up using the motion sensor. Motion meant garage open, no motion meant closed. This worked ok. The sad thing was is that it ate the battery so fast. Like a month.\n\nThe other part of the SmartThings that was cool but failed was the outlet. We used it to turn our Xmas lights on and off. It was plugged into an outlet in our garage and was destroyed by the polar vortex or something. It stopped working in about 3 weeks. When the outlet was working it was magical. It would turn them on and off at a set time or we could do it from our phones to turn them on.\n\nWe also used the key fobs but that felt like I was tracking Sarah and didn't have a purpose other then that.\n\n#### Sonos\n\n  \nThe Sonos system is awesome. Do you remember when you could stream itunes to speakers connected to your airport. Remember how that never worked. Especially if you were trying to stream to many speakers. Sonos fixed that.\n\nThe Sonos system is independent of anything else. They have apps for just about every device. Once you link your music services to your Sonos you can listen all day long without any trouble.\n\nSetup was super easy. I got it setup the day we moved so that we could rock out.

				"content_html": "<p>Heckling happens. Probably it happens to me more often then others as I am a performer but it does happen to everyone. And we all do it, maybe not overtly but we still all participate in heckling in some way almost everyday. It is because people as a whole are snarky and mean. Individuals are nice but the group is mean.</p>\n<p>An extreme example of heckling happened to me this last weekend. I was street performing in downtown Greeley(which you should come and watch on Fridays…just saying), and this gentlemen had had a little bit to drink. One of the highlights of my show is that I juggle fire. This is because fire equals tips and tips equal me purchasing new toys. I build this up a lot during my show to get people excited. This gentleman wasn&rsquo;t happy with me juggling fire suggesting instead that I juggle grenades. I mentioned that unfortunately that juggling grenades was frowned upon by the local police so I couldn&rsquo;t do it. He mumbled something involving him having an Ak-47 and whatever.</p>\n<p>Now a normal person may have been nervous with the basic threat of violence. And now I realize that what he said wasn&rsquo;t cool. What I did instead was push back. Not saying anything mean or rude but basically telling him that the people weren&rsquo;t there to watch him, though if he had a show I would be happy to stop mine and allow him to perform. He spluttered a little bit and then sat silent for a while.</p>\n<p>What I did was bring the spotlight to him. Most people think they are hilarious add drinking to that and you get a perfect storm. By putting the spotlight on him he was forced to face the blunt force that is the general public. Most people don&rsquo;t want this. In fact if you aren&rsquo;t expecting this it is hard to react in a way that doesn&rsquo;t make you look like an idiot.</p>\n<p>I figured that I had silenced him for the remainder of the show. Unfortunately I underestimated the amount of alcohol he had consumed as well as his need for attention. At one point during the show he yelled that I should do the splits while juggling. What? It was weird. Then he proceeded to get up and drop into the splits. Even more weird. This showed me that he was ready for the big time. He now had to be part of the show. I had to get him on my side in order to be able to finish the show.</p>\n<p>Luckily it was about time for the finale. I cut the Diabolo bit short and moved on to the torches.

				"content_text": "\nHeckling happens. Probably it happens to me more often then others as I am a performer but it does happen to everyone. And we all do it, maybe not overtly but we still all participate in heckling in some way almost everyday. It is because people as a whole are snarky and mean. Individuals are nice but the group is mean.\n\nAn extreme example of heckling happened to me this last weekend. I was street performing in downtown Greeley(which you should come and watch on Fridays…just saying), and this gentlemen had had a little bit to drink. One of the highlights of my show is that I juggle fire. This is because fire equals tips and tips equal me purchasing new toys. I build this up a lot during my show to get people excited. This gentleman wasn't happy with me juggling fire suggesting instead that I juggle grenades. I mentioned that unfortunately that juggling grenades was frowned upon by the local police so I couldn't do it. He mumbled something involving him having an Ak-47 and whatever.\n\nNow a normal person may have been nervous with the basic threat of violence. And now I realize that what he said wasn't cool. What I did instead was push back. Not saying anything mean or rude but basically telling him that the people weren't there to watch him, though if he had a show I would be happy to stop mine and allow him to perform. He spluttered a little bit and then sat silent for a while.\n\nWhat I did was bring the spotlight to him. Most people think they are hilarious add drinking to that and you get a perfect storm. By putting the spotlight on him he was forced to face the blunt force that is the general public. Most people don't want this. In fact if you aren't expecting this it is hard to react in a way that doesn't make you look like an idiot.\n\nI figured that I had silenced him for the remainder of the show. Unfortunately I underestimated the amount of alcohol he had consumed as well as his need for attention. At one point during the show he yelled that I should do the splits while juggling. What? It was weird. Then he proceeded to get up and drop into the splits. Even more weird. This showed me that he was ready for the big time. He now had to be part of the show. I had to get him on my side in order to be able to finish the show.\n\nLuckily it was about time for the finale. I cut the Diabolo bit short and moved on to the torches. I set up the rola-bola, got the torches dipped in fuel and asked for a lighter(knowing full well that he had one). He said he had one and brought it up. I let him light the torches while I held them. Thanked him, got the crowd to applaud him and sent him back to the audience. He was now invested in the trick/performance.

It means that you have better traction on ice and snow because all your wheels are going. It does not mean that you stop faster it just means you can drive faster. See number one about going slower.

Speaking of turning: remember to use your turn signals so other drivers know what in the world you are doing when you slow down in an intersection.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These three things are simple and should keep us all safer and allow us to go about our business without crashing.

On the plus side I really enjoy the books I read, on the minus side is the fact that I rarely experience the joy of surprise that comes from reading a new book.\n\nIn high school my future brother-in-law went to all the teachers he respected and asked them for a list of books that he should read. I don't remember how long it was but he committed himself to making his way through it. Seems like a pretty fantastic plan.\n\nI have set up a form via google for people to submit books to. It is [here][1]. Please take the time to suggest one or more books. I will also make the [list][2] view able so that you can check if the book you are suggesting is one that has been suggested.\n\n   [1]: https://docs.google.com/a/dylanreed.com/forms/d/19iC8VVfX7-5RHDIa3D-pL7mAiU0eFD_6eQW7HtTsd9w/viewform\n   [2]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjuRpKKTHJltdEp2WDJSN0hmYWlaeXRSOFRzbWk1T1E&usp=sharing\n\nPlease suggest books.

It was our first Thanksgiving in our new house and it was amazing. We made everything: Turkey, stuffing, green beans, a can of cranberry sauce cut into hearts and mashed potatoes.

Because that is how we roll.</p>\n<p>It was nice to see Sarah&rsquo;s family and share some super tasty food with them. I don&rsquo;t like to brag, thought as you all know is not really true, but our turkey was the best turkey that has ever been made. Seriously. I cannot exaggerate enough about how good it was. I imagine that when Jesus cooked a turkey for the first Thanksgiving before giving the Native people smallpox blankets, his turkey couldn&rsquo;t even touch ours.</p>\n<p>And the pies!!! Sarah&rsquo;s makes delicious pies. The pumpkin was a pumpkin custard pie… did you read that last word CUSTARD!!!! It is amazing. I am pretty sure that when pumpkin pie was invented this is what they meant to happen. It is creamy and delicious and I think I personally have eaten most of it. I don&rsquo;t share pumpkin pie very well. It is pretty much my pie. Sarah also made a pecan pie which I didn&rsquo;t eat because of the previously mentioned pumpkin pie but I heard good things about it. The apple pie is baked in a brown paper bag, which means it is extra delicious. This is Sarah&rsquo;s pie of choice for the holidays. Sadly we only have one slice of each left for dessert tonight. :(</p>\n<p>After the success of our Thanksgiving my family came over for desserts for dinner and board games. Harper brought Wits and Wagers and some super complicated that involved strategy and reading. So we play Wits and Wagers. It was a lot of fun. It involves guessing numbers. What year was the first appearance of Mickey Mouse? Then everyone bets on which guess is probably closer. Then the answer is revealed and winning happens, or in my case you watch other people collect chips while slowly crying about how bad you are at winning.</p>\n<p>Saturday was my families usual crazy Thanksgiving extravaganza. It was toned down a little bit because everyone was tired. A bunch of people came over and hung out. After eating I had to head to downtown Greeley and do some juggling prior to the start of the parade of lights. I did my usual street show but without the begging for tips, though I think I would have cleaned up. It went well with the fire juggling making everyone explode with glee.</p>\n<p>Sunday was nice. We got to meet our nephew for the first time. He is a super chill little dude of about three months. We had brunch with Sarah&rsquo;s sisters and then headed to meet my family for some japanese food and to say good by to Harper and Hiromi.

And also why it is important to keep learning about your chosen skill(s). Here is an example that I have encountered:</p>\n<p>I was at an event that I do annually. I was all decked out as Dylan the Clown. Not only was I wondering around interacting with children I was also the MC for the event. One of the volunteers lets me know that another clown has shown up. Inside all I can think is &ldquo;Awesome, someone else to interact with and to hang out with the children whilst I am on stage.&rdquo; So I head over to introduce myself and learn a little about his skills/if he is interested in playing around.</p>\n<p>It was horrifying. His makeup was poorly done, not very well thought out and frankly scary. He had used yellow around his eyes instead of white(or blue or pink or almost any other color). He looked sickly. He was also under the impression that clowning just involved being rude and loud. On top of that he had brought his 6 or 7 year old daughter who just followed him around. It was creepy.</p>\n<p>Figuring that he didn&rsquo;t know any better I went over and introduced myself. After a few minutes of interaction in front of the children I asked if we could chat for a moment backstage before we continued. He agreed. Upon our arrival backstage I asked him how long he had been clowning, why he was clowning and why he had come to this event. Turns out that he thought that it would be a fun way to spend time with his daughter and had just thrown together his face/outfit this morning when he read about the event in the newspaper. Sigh.</p>\n<p>At this point I was frustrated. I pride myself on my appearance as a clown as well as the thought that I have put into costumes and the way my clown acts. I told him that there were some things he could do to adjust the experience people had with him at the event. He started to shut down. I told him that he needed to make sure that he was letting people come to him and not just push his way into peoples space by being noisy and pushy. I told him that I would be fine with him following me around so I could show him the ropes of crowd interaction. He wasn&rsquo;t interested. Whatever.</p>\n<p>The last part of our conversation I tried to set up time for us to meet out of clown and discuss clowning. He told me quite frankly that I didn&rsquo;t know what the hell I was talking about and he was going to do what he wanted. After he stormed off I went back to doing what I was doing while keeping a eye out for the other &ldquo;clown&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>I found out later that he was scary children and they asked him to leave.</p>\n<p>The sadest part of this story is about ten years prior I was that guy. This is because no matter how much training you have, studying you do or mentors you have the first time you put on your clown you are absolutely terrifying.

				"content_html": "<p>If you live under a rock you may not have heard that Harper was the CTO for Obama&rsquo;s campaign. Which is/was amazing. I have wanted to do a post about it for a while but couldn&rsquo;t think of the best way to write it. I was worried that it would come off as a little brother being jealous of a successful older brother. Which I totally am. No lie. I am super jealous of Harper.</p>\n<p>The thing about me being jealous is that it is covered by how proud I am of my brother. Harper has worked his ass off to get to where he is. He broke how technology and elections work. He treated the campaign like a high stakes start-up. At one point during the campaign I remember Harper saying that he can&rsquo;t fuck this up but he didn&rsquo;t have enough control to prevent that. He couldn&rsquo;t control how people voted but he knew he could get blamed if they failed.</p>\n<p>The hard part for me about Harper being on the campaign is that all I heard about was how awesome it was that Harper was working on the campaign. Over and over again. I would read something about Harper online and then meet my parents for dinner and they would tell me about the same article. Thanksgiving was a little rough because that is all anyone wanted to talk about. When Harper got the job I realized that it didn&rsquo;t matter what I did nothing I did would top working for the Obama 2012 campaign. I realize how negative that sounds but it helped me get over a mountain that has been in my way for years.</p>\n<p>The sibling competition that I had set up in my mind between Harper and I. The prize was my parents love. Not that I felt unloved. I just always felt second to Harper. But when Harper became internet famous I realized that while I would never be as well known as Harper or work to make the world a better place like Harper has been I can finally become the person I want to be. This didn&rsquo;t all come from Harper being CTO. It has been evolving over the years as my relationship with my family has improved and I have learned more about myself. I think I finally see the same person when I look in the mirror that other people see.</p>\n<p>Harper and I both want the world to be a better place. Harper seems to operate on the macro level. He uses technology to make things change and to influence things he believes in. I am much more micro. I help people change tires, make people laugh and wish everyone did the same. One of the people who works for my dad said, &ldquo;Harper is going to change the world and if everyone was like Dylan we wouldn&rsquo;t need to.&rdquo; Aside from making feel pretty cool it also made me think that I need to focus on little things I can do that will make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>I may never cure a disease or help a president get reelected but I can bring joy to people whenever I can, I can work with organizations I believe in at the local level to end child-abuse or educate people on the importance of reading.</p>\n<p>Doing good is hard. It is almost always easier to not do good. Doing good requires that you give of yourself in someway. Every year for at least the past 10 years I have been the MC for the Weld County Children&rsquo;s Festival. It is the one event every year that I do for free. I have been on the board for it in the past and will probably get back on it again in the future. The Children&rsquo;s Festival is an event that gives a book to every child in attendance. THat is something I believe in and so I am willing to give up an entire Saturday to make sure that people have fun. Anyway, back to Harper and having a famous sibling. I have a few pro-tips if you ever find yourself with a famous sibling. Most of the things that are annoying about famous siblings are also amazing. First the pro tips.</p>\n<p><strong>Never read the comments:</strong> This was a lesson I had to learn. I am aware of the greater internet fuckwad theory, but I didn&rsquo;t realize how that would effect me. When the news of Harper being the CTO broke it was a big deal on the internet. Articles were written, the same photo was used over and over again, people made comments. I was excited for Harper so I would read the articles which would lead to the comments. In turn that would lead to me getting pissed off. People who didn&rsquo;t know Harper were saying horrible things. It was upsetting. Harper is my brother and I don&rsquo;t like mean people or bullies. I never responded and stopped reading comments.</p>\n<p>**They are what people are going to want to talk about with you: **Most people don&rsquo;t have a famous sibling, so they don&rsquo;t realize that hearing about in every single conversation is really really annoying. They also don&rsquo;t know how many times you have heard the same comment or discussed the article. So be polite. Discuss it with them. It better to have people be excited about it then to rant about it.</p>\n<p><strong>You can&rsquo;t win:</strong> Because it isn&rsquo;t a competition. Everyone has different strengths. Focus on what you are good at and don&rsquo;t worry about what they are good at.</p>\n<p><strong>People will get confused:</strong> I had one of my dad&rsquo;s employees thank me for my work on the campaign. It was super awkward. Harper and I look similar except that Harper has a big ol&rsquo;nasty beard, huge holes in his ears and red hair. But this will happen. So be cool and don&rsquo;t be a dick about it.</p>\n",

It is almost always easier to not do good. Doing good requires that you give of yourself in someway. Every year for at least the past 10 years I have been the MC for the Weld County Children's Festival. It is the one event every year that I do for free. I have been on the board for it in the past and will probably get back on it again in the future. The Children's Festival is an event that gives a book to every child in attendance. THat is something I believe in and so I am willing to give up an entire Saturday to make sure that people have fun. Anyway, back to Harper and having a famous sibling. I have a few pro-tips if you ever find yourself with a famous sibling. Most of the things that are annoying about famous siblings are also amazing. First the pro tips.\n\n**Never read the comments:** This was a lesson I had to learn. I am aware of the greater internet fuckwad theory, but I didn't realize how that would effect me. When the news of Harper being the CTO broke it was a big deal on the internet. Articles were written, the same photo was used over and over again, people made comments. I was excited for Harper so I would read the articles which would lead to the comments. In turn that would lead to me getting pissed off. People who didn't know Harper were saying horrible things. It was upsetting. Harper is my brother and I don't like mean people or bullies. I never responded and stopped reading comments.\n\n**They are what people are going to want to talk about with you: **Most people don't have a famous sibling, so they don't realize that hearing about in every single conversation is really really annoying. They also don't know how many times you have heard the same comment or discussed the article. So be polite. Discuss it with them. It better to have people be excited about it then to rant about it.\n\n**You can't win:** Because it isn't a competition. Everyone has different strengths. Focus on what you are good at and don't worry about what they are good at.\n\n**People will get confused:** I had one of my dad's employees thank me for my work on the campaign. It was super awkward. Harper and I look similar except that Harper has a big ol'nasty beard, huge holes in his ears and red hair. But this will happen. So be cool and don't be a dick about it.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2720/4140130596_c331bb56bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Jugglings\">Last Tuesday I spent three hours on stilts. Not only was it super hot but it has been a while since I had spent much time on stilts. I forgot the trick of wearing long socks so that the straps don&rsquo;t dig into my legs. I regret this. I have a pretty awesome blister on my leg. It isn&rsquo;t super painful but it also isn&rsquo;t awesome.</p>\n<p>I have been entertaining for 15+ years now. When I was just starting I could do anything. I would spend a couple hours on my stilts and not even feel it the next day. Now three hours on stilts requires about three days to recover. Three years ago I did another job where I was on my stilts for 5+ hours and I was fine the next day. Tired but fine. Now I am not so lucky.</p>\n<p>Part of this is that I am out of shape. When I was 18 I did gymnastics and dance four to five days a week. I was able to force my way through things. I had the physical ability to recover fast and work for long hours. Now I walk about 10,ooo steps a day and do yoga a couple times a week, unless I don&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>I also don&rsquo;t practice enough anymore. This is more of a cocky thing then any other reason. I know that I need to practice but I have become comfortable with my abilities and I am still able to make people laugh with all of my current skills, so why learn anything new. Starting next week I am setting aside time to practice. Since I still can&rsquo;t idle on my unicycle I am going to start with that skill. Juggling 5 balls is after that.</p>\n<p>The other problem I have with physical side of entertaining is that a lot of it hurts. I have broken my body. I have crappy knees, a crappy elbow, bad shoulders and weak ankles. While none of these affect my performance it means that it takes me longer and longer to recover from each job. I would have a hard time doing multiple shows in one day.</p>\n<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that I will do anything for a laugh.

				"content_text": "\n![][1]Last Tuesday I spent three hours on stilts. Not only was it super hot but it has been a while since I had spent much time on stilts. I forgot the trick of wearing long socks so that the straps don't dig into my legs. I regret this. I have a pretty awesome blister on my leg. It isn't super painful but it also isn't awesome.\n\n   [1]: http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2720/4140130596_c331bb56bb.jpg (Jugglings)\n\nI have been entertaining for 15+ years now. When I was just starting I could do anything. I would spend a couple hours on my stilts and not even feel it the next day. Now three hours on stilts requires about three days to recover. Three years ago I did another job where I was on my stilts for 5+ hours and I was fine the next day. Tired but fine. Now I am not so lucky.\n\nPart of this is that I am out of shape. When I was 18 I did gymnastics and dance four to five days a week. I was able to force my way through things. I had the physical ability to recover fast and work for long hours. Now I walk about 10,ooo steps a day and do yoga a couple times a week, unless I don't.\n\nI also don't practice enough anymore. This is more of a cocky thing then any other reason. I know that I need to practice but I have become comfortable with my abilities and I am still able to make people laugh with all of my current skills, so why learn anything new. Starting next week I am setting aside time to practice. Since I still can't idle on my unicycle I am going to start with that skill. Juggling 5 balls is after that.\n\nThe other problem I have with physical side of entertaining is that a lot of it hurts. I have broken my body. I have crappy knees, a crappy elbow, bad shoulders and weak ankles. While none of these affect my performance it means that it takes me longer and longer to recover from each job. I would have a hard time doing multiple shows in one day.\n\nIt doesn't help that I will do anything for a laugh. I continue to abuse my body which, strangely enough, doesn't make my joints feel better. Since I don't have any desire to stop I have to figure out a way to make my body better. I need to work on getting back into shape. Probably not the same shape I was in when I did gymnastics and dance but at least have the muscle endurance that I can do a 45 minute juggling show without my shoulders trying to kill me.\n\nWish my luck. Hopefully this will get me learning new tricks and make me a better entertainer. I will try to post progress.\n",

Add to this the normal things that are life and I need to figure out how to get things finished. Part of the problem is that I am not recieving all the support I need from my partners in crime. Some of this is laziness on their end some of it is me not asking for help when I need it. The other part of the problem is that I love all of my projects. ALL OF THEM.</p>\n<p>This post is to hopefully put these projects in prespective for me allowing me to choose an order to finish them. So without further ado here are the projects I am working on and their current status.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/media/2012/04/Arcade.png\"><img src=\"/media/2012/04/Arcade-200x300.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Arcade\"></a>Falling Cats - This is a pretty big one. I started making this one more then a year ago and it is slowly coming into being. I am at the ever so crucial bug smashing stage. The problem that I am running into is that the game isn&rsquo;t what I want it to be. I don&rsquo;t want to take any steps backwards and succumb to feature creep, but&hellip; there are things that I want the game to have that will make the game awesome. Not sure which way to go with this one. Those of you that don&rsquo;t know Falling Cats is a game where cats fall from the sky and you control a blob that catches the cats. The original plan was to have a story mode complete with boss fights and an arcade mode where you just try to catch as many cats as possible. I chopped out the story mode to save time. Last night as I was looking at the game I realized that that was a mistake. I am now trying to decide if I release Falling Cats as it is to get it done or take the extra couple weeks to add in the story mode. As it stands this is probably priority number one, I have invested a lot of my time into this project so I feel I should finish it soon. The problem is that I don&rsquo;t know which direction to go. Do I polish and publish what I have or do I add story mode and work my ass off for a another month before publishing?</li>\n<li>Learning Python - This is more of a pet project. I am interested in learning to program so that I will no longer have to use GameSalad to make the games that I want. I should be able to get a good handle on this if I focus on it for a couple weeks or a month at the most. The problem is that I find learning programing to be BORING. I guess it isn&rsquo;t that bad I just have a hard time staying focussed when I am learning. I am going to be Learning Python the Hard Way, thanks to Harper buying me a course at UDEMY, I just need to start it. I think the hardest thing with this project is that the value comes later.</li>\n<li>Magic - I have been learning/ performing magic for a while now. Sadly I haven&rsquo;t been practicing as much as I should or learning new tricks. I have a whole slew of new tricks I want to learn but I have been working on other things instead. Magic is just so time consuming to learn, taking so much practice before you get the pay off of blowing someones mind. I have also notices the last couple times I have performed card tricks that my slights are weak due to lack of practice. I need to dedicate about an hour a day to practicing magic in order to get my skills back up to speed and learn some new tricks. <img src=\"/media/2012/04/photo-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"photo\"></li>\n<li>Fast Milo - My dad wrote/illustrated <a href=\"http://www.fastmilo.com/\">Fast Milo</a> when Harper and I were kids. It is the story of Milo who likes to go fast. I have read it many times and think it is awesome. I am currently working on digitizing/coloring Fast Milo so we can publish it digitally a little slicker then how it is currently. This project was actually my dads idea and I thought it was a good one. I am doing this entire thing on my iPad which has been an interesting experience. Currently I just have one page done and it took me about 2 hours from start to finish. I am not 100% please as I am not sure if I should add shading or if I should leave it flat. I spend so much time looking at comic books and I am amazed at how colorists are able to add so much depth to images. I think I will go back and shade the first page and then let Harper and my dad decide which one they like better.</li>\n<li>Awesome Guys/ Mompheous Bros. - I am currently in the process of editing and lengthening some stories that I have children&rsquo;s stories that I have written. Not sure where these are going but I have at least one that is ready to be sent out to agents/publishers for rejection letters publishing. Of course that means that I need to do research on children&rsquo;s book publishers, unless I want to use <a href=\"http://graphicly.com\">Graphicly</a> to do the non-traditional approach. If I go that route  I will need to find illustrator(s) or illustrate myself, which could potentially be a pain in the ass. The nice thing about this project is that once I send stuff off to publishers I will have at least a month to work on other projects while I wait to hear back. However if I go the non-traditional route I will need to do all of the publishers job myself.</li>\n<li><img src=\"http://joeandem.com//media/2010/06/joeandems.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"logo\">Joe and Em&rsquo;s-  Sarah and I started this blog a while ago. Not very well&hellip; but we started it. The hope is to make it into a look into our handmade life. The problem with this project has been time. Sarah is the primary person behind this project and she has had a crazy school year. The hope is that this summer we can really get to work on this blog and get into a routine of posting that will allow us to be successful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am not going to lie. This process of listing out all of my current projects did nothing to help me prioritize. Damnit. I just need to commit to finishing them all I guess. Probably do some sort of crazy schedule that will allow me to work on each one everyday. Oh and this Fast Milo sprite I made totally has hands&hellip; they are just a little too light for the white background.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/2012/04/Milo_Milo.gif\"><img src=\"/media/2012/04/Milo_Milo.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"Milo_Milo\"></a></p>\n",

I am going to be Learning Python the Hard Way, thanks to Harper buying me a course at UDEMY, I just need to start it. I think the hardest thing with this project is that the value comes later.\n  3. Magic - I have been learning/ performing magic for a while now. Sadly I haven't been practicing as much as I should or learning new tricks. I have a whole slew of new tricks I want to learn but I have been working on other things instead. Magic is just so time consuming to learn, taking so much practice before you get the pay off of blowing someones mind. I have also notices the last couple times I have performed card tricks that my slights are weak due to lack of practice. I need to dedicate about an hour a day to practicing magic in order to get my skills back up to speed and learn some new tricks. ![][3]\n  4. Fast Milo - My dad wrote/illustrated [Fast Milo][4] when Harper and I were kids. It is the story of Milo who likes to go fast. I have read it many times and think it is awesome. I am currently working on digitizing/coloring Fast Milo so we can publish it digitally a little slicker then how it is currently. This project was actually my dads idea and I thought it was a good one. I am doing this entire thing on my iPad which has been an interesting experience. Currently I just have one page done and it took me about 2 hours from start to finish. I am not 100% please as I am not sure if I should add shading or if I should leave it flat. I spend so much time looking at comic books and I am amazed at how colorists are able to add so much depth to images. I think I will go back and shade the first page and then let Harper and my dad decide which one they like better.\n  5. Awesome Guys/ Mompheous Bros. - I am currently in the process of editing and lengthening some stories that I have children's stories that I have written. Not sure where these are going but I have at least one that is ready to be sent out to agents/publishers for rejection letters publishing. Of course that means that I need to do research on children's book publishers, unless I want to use [Graphicly][5] to do the non-traditional approach. If I go that route  I will need to find illustrator(s) or illustrate myself, which could potentially be a pain in the ass. The nice thing about this project is that once I send stuff off to publishers I will have at least a month to work on other projects while I wait to hear back. However if I go the non-traditional route I will need to do all of the publishers job myself.\n  6. ![][6]Joe and Em's-  Sarah and I started this blog a while ago. Not very well... but we started it. The hope is to make it into a look into our handmade life. The problem with this project has been time. Sarah is the primary person behind this project and she has had a crazy school year. The hope is that this summer we can really get to work on this blog and get into a routine of posting that will allow us to be successful.\n  \n\n\n   [1]: /media/2012/04/Arcade-200x300.png (Arcade)\n   [2]: /media/2012/04/Arcade.png\n   [3]: /media/2012/04/photo-225x300.jpg (photo)\n   [4]: http://www.fastmilo.com/\n   [5]: http://graphicly.com\n   [6]: http://joeandem.com//media/2010/06/joeandems.png (logo)\n\n  \nI am not going to lie. This process of listing out all of my current projects did nothing to help me prioritize. Damnit. I just need to commit to finishing them all I guess. Probably do some sort of crazy schedule that will allow me to work on each one everyday. Oh and this Fast Milo sprite I made totally has hands... they are just a little too light for the white background.\n\n[![][7]][8]\n\n   [7]: /media/2012/04/Milo_Milo.gif (Milo_Milo)\n   [8]: /media/2012/04/Milo_Milo.gif\n",

I remember when I had grown my hair out and he offered me $100 to cut it off. I took it.

What made these books different is that they are truly written for first time programmers with no previous knowledge. True that are also wittern for 12 year olds but hey I am still 12 at heart. I have been working my way through the first book and enjoying myself because the book follows this template.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Here is some code</li>\n<li>Copy this code</li>\n<li>Run this code</li>\n<li>Here is why it does that</li>\n<li>Here are some other ways to accomplish the same task</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For one who is a visual learner this is working great. It allows me to look at code writtern by someone else, analyze and understand it and then apply it to what I want to build. Once I finish the first book, which is pretty much bare bones, none graphical games (hangman, tic tac toe, guess the number) then I will move on to the second book which involves making games using pygame. This allows you to have actual graphics that aren&rsquo;t just a square or circle.</p>\n<p>I am pretty excited to learn and will probably go onto Learn Python the Hard Way after those two so that I have a full knowledge of the power of the Python.</p>\n",

What made these books different is that they are truly written for first time programmers with no previous knowledge. True that are also wittern for 12 year olds but hey I am still 12 at heart. I have been working my way through the first book and enjoying myself because the book follows this template.\n\n   [3]: http://inventwithpython.com/\n\n  1. Here is some code\n  2. Copy this code\n  3. Run this code\n  4. Here is why it does that\n  5. Here are some other ways to accomplish the same task\n  \n\n\n  \nFor one who is a visual learner this is working great. It allows me to look at code writtern by someone else, analyze and understand it and then apply it to what I want to build. Once I finish the first book, which is pretty much bare bones, none graphical games (hangman, tic tac toe, guess the number) then I will move on to the second book which involves making games using pygame. This allows you to have actual graphics that aren't just a square or circle.\n\nI am pretty excited to learn and will probably go onto Learn Python the Hard Way after those two so that I have a full knowledge of the power of the Python.\n",

I would love to become a pro member because I think that game salad is a solid group and that they are doing their best, but asking people to pay $499 to be a pro level beta tester is just silly. As numerous people have suggested on the game salad forums, Game Salad needs to do a tiered pricing plan: $99 removes the Playhaven add but doesn&rsquo;t unlock any of the other features, $499 gets you all of the pro features.

They have thousands of faithful users who just want to make games, a lot who have stated that they would pay up to $100 to remove the ad, yet GameSalad is only interested in converting people to the full Pro Membership instead of realizing that convincing 5 people to remove the ad at $100 would be easier then convincing 1 person to spend $500.

The interface is not set up as nice or seem as well thought out as the kindle fire. The kindle fire was, for the week that I had it before I got the iPad, my comics tablet.

In fact I wouldn&rsquo;t be writing this post if it weren&rsquo;t for the hateful people that apparently frequent the same 7-11 that I do.</p>\n<p>I was walking across the parking lot after getting my slurpee wearing plaid toms, green sweatpants and a hoody that has rainbows on it. I hear someone behind me say in a contemptuous voice &quot; I like rainbows. &quot; In my mind I thought: oh goodie some cool people. Then I hear the hate word &quot; FAG!!!&quot; It wasn&rsquo;t mumbled under breath, it was said with force and hate. At that point I turned to see who it was that was full of so much hate.

In fact I wouldn't be writing this post if it weren't for the hateful people that apparently frequent the same 7-11 that I do.\n\nI was walking across the parking lot after getting my slurpee wearing plaid toms, green sweatpants and a hoody that has rainbows on it. I hear someone behind me say in a contemptuous voice \" I like rainbows. \" In my mind I thought: oh goodie some cool people. Then I hear the hate word \" FAG!!!\" It wasn't mumbled under breath, it was said with force and hate. At that point I turned to see who it was that was full of so much hate.

I am actually excited about a couple launch titles:\n\n  * Pilotwings Resort\n  * Steel Diver\n  * Super Monkey Ball\n  * The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\n  * Star Fox 64\n  * Resident Evil: Mercenaries\n  \n\n\n  \nWhat I think is funny is that a lot of these games are remakes of games Nintendo has released numerous times, I am actually surprised at the number that I want to play. I am also surprised that there isn't a Mario title included in the launch, though the inclusion of everyone's favorite Zelda game was a good plan on Nintendo's part.\n",

Though I have killed the story about the tomato that wants to be a boxer, I will be updating it more frequently. I am planning on using it as a place to experiment with comics and to use my new found drawing abilities to actually create something.\n\n   [3]: /media/2011/02/Screen-shot-2011-02-15-at-5.32.38-AM.png (Screen shot 2011-02-15 at 5.32.38 AM)\n   [4]: http://veggiefight.com\n\nYou might be wondering how you can keep track of all of this stuff seeing as how it is spread all over the internet. I would suggest either subscribe to each site, which you can do at each site, or you can just follow me on [twitter][5] where I will be posting every time I post something at any of the sites.\n\n   [5]: http://twitter.com/awesomeguy\n\nEveryone have a nice Tuesday and look forward to Dylan's Great Drawing Experiment (or DGDE) to start tomorrow. And thanks for all of the birthday wishes, it was nice to hear from everyone.\n",

This worries me a little bit because I don&rsquo;t really want to be a hermit. It may be too late but we can hope.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that over the past couple years, while working for my dad and then going to CSU that I had very little free time. This suited me just fine. I enjoyed being busy all the time and as I learned yesterday I am not very good at being left to my own devices.</p>\n<p>I got up yesterday morning and made breakfast as per the usual, I then saw Sarah off to her day at work and then I set up my laptop on the table and started working on the dylanreed.com redesign, which is getting there but I am not 100% jazzed about it yet. That is is. After that I got up to do human things, such as eat and something else that ends in a &rsquo;t', but not much else.</p>\n<p>The problem is that I had errands to do that need to get done this week, and don&rsquo;t worry once my phone finishes syncing I will be off to do them, but instead of doing them yesterday I designed, drew, played games, drew and designed most of the day. On a drawing/design front it was pretty productive but I felt like a total slacker that evening when I had to admit that the two things I was supposed to do yesterday were incomplete but I had taken the time to redesign a website that doesn&rsquo;t make money or get read by very many people.</p>\n<p>Then it hit me, this is why Harper and Co have the Canoe Club.

				"content_text": "\n[![][1]][2] Yesterday I didn't leave my house. This worries me a little bit because I don't really want to be a hermit. It may be too late but we can hope.\n\n   [1]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/23afd92680.jpg (Chibi)\n   [2]: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4076/5413438219_7cd7e0898c.jpg\n\nIt seems to me that over the past couple years, while working for my dad and then going to CSU that I had very little free time. This suited me just fine. I enjoyed being busy all the time and as I learned yesterday I am not very good at being left to my own devices.\n\nI got up yesterday morning and made breakfast as per the usual, I then saw Sarah off to her day at work and then I set up my laptop on the table and started working on the dylanreed.com redesign, which is getting there but I am not 100% jazzed about it yet. That is is. After that I got up to do human things, such as eat and something else that ends in a 't', but not much else.\n\nThe problem is that I had errands to do that need to get done this week, and don't worry once my phone finishes syncing I will be off to do them, but instead of doing them yesterday I designed, drew, played games, drew and designed most of the day. On a drawing/design front it was pretty productive but I felt like a total slacker that evening when I had to admit that the two things I was supposed to do yesterday were incomplete but I had taken the time to redesign a website that doesn't make money or get read by very many people.\n\nThen it hit me, this is why Harper and Co have the Canoe Club. It forces you to leave the house. Sure when they get to the Wormhole they may just sit around and do computer stuff but they are outside of their houses. I need this. I need to make friends with people in Greeley that can meet up once a week to make sure that I get out of my house more then just to go to work. Of course since I do have a job it can make it more difficult to make a set time but I am willing to try.\n\nAs far as drawing went yesterday I drew the Chibi at the top of the post and I also did my personal favorite drawing of 2011.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\" caption=\"Enter the Haytrix\"][![][3]][4][/caption]\n\n   [3]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/b62b3db238.jpg (Horpheus)\n   [4]: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/5414049026_0defd1d890.jpg\n\nI also drew a jet but I am not as jazzed about that.\n\n[![][5]][6]\n\n   [5]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/a4456f97ed.jpg (Jet Set)\n   [6]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/a4456f97ed.jpg\n\nGoals for next week:\n\n  1. Design Characters for secret project #1\n  2. Finish my iPhone game\n  3. Leave house on my day off and go somewhere(that would be Friday for those tat care)\n  4. Get ready to be Thirty next Monday\n  5. ???\n  \n\n\n  \nHope everyone has a nice weekend and eats an ungodly amount of food while watching all the commercials this Sunday.\n",

What an perfect opportunity to learn to draw comics. Of course the problem is that comics are not considered an art form at my school so doing it for a project would never work out. But... I am taking a year off from school so I could in my free time learn to draw super heros.\n\nHere is the plan. I have five books on drawing super heros. The plan is to make it through one book a month and then draw the same drawing at the end of each month. In theory it should get better. I picked a page from one of the books and attempted to draw the pose on that page as a baseline.\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"480\" caption=\"Meet Drawing Man\"][![][2]][3][/caption]\n\n   [2]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/ac4fdf69a7.jpg (Drawing is Hard)\n   [3]: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4129/5202013058_028da18b40_o.jpg\n\nAs you may have noticed I made some notes of what I think needs to be better. His foot shape is terrible and his straighter leg is funky. Also that ankle is really really skinny. His hand, the one in the front looks special. And his face is grey... because I don't have a flesh tone marker, I [could][4], but I don't. I am not sure what else looks weird so please help. There is a chance that his torso is off but I am not sure.\n\n   [4]: http://www.dickblick.com/lists/wishlist/3D7SKCUGDOZQY/publicview/\n",

I think that schools do not take threats seriously and that there is still a danger of school shootings happening in about any school. I woke up this morning not thinking of school shootings but about what I had to do in school today. I have an assignment I should be working on for composition class but I instead spent the last hour and a half reading about Columbine.</p>\n<p>I remember sitting in my classes at Greeley Central when all of that went down. We watched the news coverage as it happened and I remember being so confused by what was going on. All the coverage was unclear and confused, as it should have been, but the one thing that they kept saying, the one thing that seemed so important to get out, was that the shooters listened to angry music, played violent video games and were trouble.</p>\n<p>As the years have passed it has come to light that there were probably some underlying psychological problems that the shooters had coupled with bullying and other social norms that are accepted in high schools. These kids had problems, problems that were ignored by both school officials, parents and law enforcement. It is my hope that because of tragedies like Columbine that we as a society are better at helping people so that this sort of thing never happens again.</p>\n<p>But of course it has happened again. The shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 was another horrible tragedy that could have been prevented if the shooter would have been giving help, treated less like an outcast and more like a human being, and maybe just maybe prevented from getting a gun. Because really all of these shootings could be prevented by limiting people&rsquo;s access to fire arms.</p>\n<p>I understand that the Right to Bear Arms is a fundemental right of americans. Go us.

I am not saying that we need to get rid of guns, though that would be my prefered solution, what I am saying is that we need to make it damn hard for people to get guns. And why does anyone need more then one gun.</p>\n<p>Sorry, I kind of went off on gun control a little bit. What I really meant to say with this blog post is that we, as a society, need to remember what has happened in the past an learn from it. Sticking our head in the sand and pretending that nothing bad has happenend or is going to happen is just silly. We are all human, we all make choices, we are all different. It is impossible to say that something like this will never happen again and we need to try and make it as difficult as possible to get the tools needed to do this.  If guns where harder to get, then the shooters at Columbine would have possibly had less ammo or less guns. Maybe they would have just continued to be pissed off and not decided to kill people.</p>\n<p>I would ask that everyone take a moment today and think about what happened at Columbine. Think about the people that died, including the shooters because they are people too, and think about what we can do to prevent this sort of thing from happening again. My heart goes out to victims of shootings no matter where they are in the world. To people with violence in their hearts and minds: Please stop hurting people.</p>\n",

And why does anyone need more then one gun.\n\nSorry, I kind of went off on gun control a little bit. What I really meant to say with this blog post is that we, as a society, need to remember what has happened in the past an learn from it. Sticking our head in the sand and pretending that nothing bad has happenend or is going to happen is just silly. We are all human, we all make choices, we are all different. It is impossible to say that something like this will never happen again and we need to try and make it as difficult as possible to get the tools needed to do this.  If guns where harder to get, then the shooters at Columbine would have possibly had less ammo or less guns. Maybe they would have just continued to be pissed off and not decided to kill people.\n\nI would ask that everyone take a moment today and think about what happened at Columbine. Think about the people that died, including the shooters because they are people too, and think about what we can do to prevent this sort of thing from happening again. My heart goes out to victims of shootings no matter where they are in the world. To people with violence in their hearts and minds: Please stop hurting people.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Tabletop role-playing games are a lot of fun. Sure not all people would agree with me, in fact if you are one of those people you should stop reading now. I am not going to try and convince you that you should play tabletop RPGs. What I would like to talk about is playing dungeons and dragons with a party of less than the four or five recommended players.</p>\n<p>This has been a problem since I started playing D&amp;D and has only gotten worse due to unforeseen instances of 13-year-old-girl-ness. When I started playing D&amp;D it was with Matt, my brother -in-law, and my good friend Jon. We played one module bringing characters from level one to dead in the first three sessions. This was due, in large part to the DM (Dungeon Master) not taking into account that the module was built for 4+ adventurers and two just wouldn&rsquo;t cut it. After that adventure we added another player and had three players and one DM. This made things a lot easier and while we barely won most fights we still won them.</p>\n<p>After almost a year of playing I was ready to try my hand at DMing. I had come up with an idea to have a gladiatorial arena and the PCs were slaves required to fight in the arena. The style was going to be very combat heavy and I thought quite a bit of fun. I asked the players to create any character they wanted. And I mean any character. If they played a level adjusted race they had to take the lesser stats if they played non-level adjusted they got awesome stats, I figured that would level out the game a little. I asked them to create character sheets for levels 1-20 so that we could play it out in one huge gaming session.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we never got to play. Our normal D&amp;D DM, Matt, decided that I was screwing up as a DM and he didn&rsquo;t want to play, unfortunately he didn&rsquo;t say it in this way. He chose instead to insult me personally and the 13-year-old-girl-ness happened. The aftermath was that Jon and I continue to play games and have had to figure out how to play a 4+ player game with only 1 player. I did a lot of research on the internet about solo campaigns and what you need to adjust etc. There isn&rsquo;t a lot of information so I figured that I would share what we are currently doing and how it is working.</p>\n<p>The Problem with solo campaigns is that all of the monsters are rated based on a party size of 4. This means that a kobold, which has an encounter level (EL) of ¼, should be easy for 4 level 1 characters. With a single level one character that one kobold suddenly has an EL of 1, a much more difficult fight for the character. As monsters go up in EL the distance between their skills and that of a single PC increase at an alarming pace, so what do you do?</p>\n<p>You use level adjusted races without counting the level adjustment, roll super stats and use the Tome of Battle/Gestalt Classes. These three things allow your character to do insane things. It also creates a super heroic character that can go toe to toe with a dragon.</p>\n<p>Using level adjusted races without counting it is a fantastic way to turn the tables on the monsters. A level one +1 level adjusted character is really a level two character. This makes that character more able to fight monsters at its class level. This is especially true if you choose a level adjusted level with monstrous humanoid levels. Depending on your campaign and how powerful you want the PCs to be I would limit it to +1 or +2 level adjusted races. Anything more might be world breaking.</p>\n<p>Rolling super stats just sounds cool. And it is a lot of fun. It is talked about in the Dungeon Masters Guide, though I didn&rsquo;t realize that until we had already started the adventure. Here is what normal rolling consists of: Roll 4d6 six times discard lowest die of each roll and that is your ability score. For our super stats we rolled 5d6 seven times, discarded the lowest two die from each roll and discarded the lowest of the seven. This gave us great scores, allowing us to maximize our characters for their class.</p>\n<p>Speaking of classes we used the Tome of Battle: Book of Nine Swords. Partially because it is such an awesome book and partially because the one adventure we did in the past where Jon played a crusader from the book, his character was insanely powerful. These classes with their martial maneuvers are fantastic and probably a little broken. Of course that doesn&rsquo;t matter since you are playing with very few characters and need to be able to kick as much ass by yourself as possible. Another option is to make up a few gestalt classes. Combine cleric with rogue or monk with wizard. You can pretty much do anything with the classes. Make sure you take the highest hit die of the two classes and bam you have a fantastic hero ready to kick a lot of ass and take names.</p>\n<p>An example of this that I am currently playing is Karkillian, an Ibixian(goat person MM3) Crusader of Erythnul. He is now level six, his ability scores are insane, 24 STR, 15 DEX, 19 CON, 12 WIS, 11 INT, 16 CHA.

				"content_text": "\nTabletop role-playing games are a lot of fun. Sure not all people would agree with me, in fact if you are one of those people you should stop reading now. I am not going to try and convince you that you should play tabletop RPGs. What I would like to talk about is playing dungeons and dragons with a party of less than the four or five recommended players. \n\nThis has been a problem since I started playing D&D and has only gotten worse due to unforeseen instances of 13-year-old-girl-ness. When I started playing D&D it was with Matt, my brother -in-law, and my good friend Jon. We played one module bringing characters from level one to dead in the first three sessions. This was due, in large part to the DM (Dungeon Master) not taking into account that the module was built for 4+ adventurers and two just wouldn't cut it. After that adventure we added another player and had three players and one DM. This made things a lot easier and while we barely won most fights we still won them. \n\nAfter almost a year of playing I was ready to try my hand at DMing. I had come up with an idea to have a gladiatorial arena and the PCs were slaves required to fight in the arena. The style was going to be very combat heavy and I thought quite a bit of fun. I asked the players to create any character they wanted. And I mean any character. If they played a level adjusted race they had to take the lesser stats if they played non-level adjusted they got awesome stats, I figured that would level out the game a little. I asked them to create character sheets for levels 1-20 so that we could play it out in one huge gaming session. \n\nUnfortunately we never got to play. Our normal D&D DM, Matt, decided that I was screwing up as a DM and he didn't want to play, unfortunately he didn't say it in this way. He chose instead to insult me personally and the 13-year-old-girl-ness happened. The aftermath was that Jon and I continue to play games and have had to figure out how to play a 4+ player game with only 1 player. I did a lot of research on the internet about solo campaigns and what you need to adjust etc. There isn't a lot of information so I figured that I would share what we are currently doing and how it is working.\n\nThe Problem with solo campaigns is that all of the monsters are rated based on a party size of 4. This means that a kobold, which has an encounter level (EL) of ¼, should be easy for 4 level 1 characters. With a single level one character that one kobold suddenly has an EL of 1, a much more difficult fight for the character. As monsters go up in EL the distance between their skills and that of a single PC increase at an alarming pace, so what do you do?\n\nYou use level adjusted races without counting the level adjustment, roll super stats and use the Tome of Battle/Gestalt Classes. These three things allow your character to do insane things. It also creates a super heroic character that can go toe to toe with a dragon. \n\nUsing level adjusted races without counting it is a fantastic way to turn the tables on the monsters. A level one +1 level adjusted character is really a level two character. This makes that character more able to fight monsters at its class level. This is especially true if you choose a level adjusted level with monstrous humanoid levels. Depending on your campaign and how powerful you want the PCs to be I would limit it to +1 or +2 level adjusted races. Anything more might be world breaking.\n\nRolling super stats just sounds cool. And it is a lot of fun. It is talked about in the Dungeon Masters Guide, though I didn't realize that until we had already started the adventure. Here is what normal rolling consists of: Roll 4d6 six times discard lowest die of each roll and that is your ability score. For our super stats we rolled 5d6 seven times, discarded the lowest two die from each roll and discarded the lowest of the seven. This gave us great scores, allowing us to maximize our characters for their class. \n\nSpeaking of classes we used the Tome of Battle: Book of Nine Swords. Partially because it is such an awesome book and partially because the one adventure we did in the past where Jon played a crusader from the book, his character was insanely powerful. These classes with their martial maneuvers are fantastic and probably a little broken. Of course that doesn't matter since you are playing with very few characters and need to be able to kick as much ass by yourself as possible. Another option is to make up a few gestalt classes. Combine cleric with rogue or monk with wizard. You can pretty much do anything with the classes. Make sure you take the highest hit die of the two classes and bam you have a fantastic hero ready to kick a lot of ass and take names.\n\nAn example of this that I am currently playing is Karkillian, an Ibixian(goat person MM3) Crusader of Erythnul. He is now level six, his ability scores are insane, 24 STR, 15 DEX, 19 CON, 12 WIS, 11 INT, 16 CHA. Because of his monstrous humanoid levels his BAB is nuts as are his hit points, basically he makes other things hurt a lot. Using his Large +1 Great axe combined with devoted spirit and stone dragon maneuvers there is very few monsters of EL 5 or lower that stand a chance toe to toe with this monsters. \n\nJon has a similar character; we recently kicked off our adventure series with a dungeon clearing for both of us. We encountered up to an EL 6 demon with our two level 5 super solders and nothing lasted more than four rounds with us. We had done some experiments with two level 5 normal classes and found that anything higher than an EL 3 monster tore us up.\n\nAs far as running a solo campaign goes I would suggest alternating who DMs and who is the player. That way you can have two separate stories going on and develop each character individually. You can always start off with an adventure where you go out together. This will allow you both to see how each character plays as well as make adjustments to the characters to make them function at optimal levels so they can live longer.\n\nGood Luck.\n",

Harper amazes me. He spent the entire day working on this site. Plugging away until it was just right. I didn&rsquo;t always have a lot to do since I was there more as a supervisor and motivator as well as to check out features as he worked on them. I think we made a pretty good team.</p>\n<p>After lunch Harper and I were back to our heads while the smart members of our respective marriages headed off for an afternoon of manicures and pedicures. Harper, still going strong, had less for me to do in the afternoon so I was in charge of picking records for us to listen to. I feel that I did a pretty good job playing DJ and I now have a pretty good mental list of music I need to find.</p>\n<p>When the ladies finally got home from their stressful day of spa visits we watched Kiki&rsquo;s Delivery Service- while Harper worked- and Invader Zim- also while Harper worked- before heading to this crazy Korean BBQ place across the street from Harper and Hiromi&rsquo;s apartment.

Sarah tagged along with me, keeping me company on the plane and making sure that I don't eat any lead paint, and for doing all that got an awesome prize.\n\nSarah and Hiromi had a spa day. They got massages, manicures and pedicures. Needless to say Harper and I were, and still are, jealous of the day they had. After we ate bagels this morning, the ladies headed off to the massage place and Harper and I headed back to their apartment to get started.\n\nSure we didn't get massages but we still had a really good time listening to old records, real records, and making web things happen. Harper amazes me. He spent the entire day working on this site. Plugging away until it was just right. I didn't always have a lot to do since I was there more as a supervisor and motivator as well as to check out features as he worked on them. I think we made a pretty good team.\n\nAfter lunch Harper and I were back to our heads while the smart members of our respective marriages headed off for an afternoon of manicures and pedicures. Harper, still going strong, had less for me to do in the afternoon so I was in charge of picking records for us to listen to. I feel that I did a pretty good job playing DJ and I now have a pretty good mental list of music I need to find.\n\nWhen the ladies finally got home from their stressful day of spa visits we watched Kiki's Delivery Service- while Harper worked- and Invader Zim- also while Harper worked- before heading to this crazy Korean BBQ place across the street from Harper and Hiromi's apartment. The place was crazy because the servers were rude, you had to cook your own meat and everything was super tasty.\n\nWe are now back to coding, or more accurately Harper is back to coding and I am writing a blog post. This blog post. \n",

Of course hanging out with other divers and in dive shops exposes you to all the new fancy equipment, which makes you realize how out of date your own equipment is and causes you to drool on all the fancy stuff other people have.</p>\n<p>My first equipment that I received was when I was twelve years old. Due to a lack of maintenance, it is no longer able to be used safely. I am still holding onto it purely for sentimental reasons. The second set of equipment I bought just before I went to California for dive school. It is really nice and I spent a lot of money on it but it is currently about eight years old.

Of course hanging out with other divers and in dive shops exposes you to all the new fancy equipment, which makes you realize how out of date your own equipment is and causes you to drool on all the fancy stuff other people have.\n\nMy first equipment that I received was when I was twelve years old. Due to a lack of maintenance, it is no longer able to be used safely. I am still holding onto it purely for sentimental reasons. The second set of equipment I bought just before I went to California for dive school. It is really nice and I spent a lot of money on it but it is currently about eight years old.

				"content_html": "<p>This last weekend was Sarah&rsquo;s open water dives to receive her open water certification. She did an awesome job and is basically a badass. For those of you interested in SCUBA diving here is a brief overview of what the training consists.</p>\n<p>The first part of the training is all classroom work. This can be done either online or in an actual classroom with an instructor. You learn a great deal of information, a lot of it scary, and all of it is important.</p>\n<p>The online instruction is pretty well done and combines reading, video and quizzes to force the strange information into your brain. The classroom session combines reading a book outside of class with the instructor explaining the principles to you.</p>\n<p>The next part of the class is the pool sessions. This is the scariest/most exciting part of the class. You finally get to take all of the theories you have heard about and put them into practice. For Sarah this was a huge leap. She is not one to be a fan of water and yet she went though this part of training like a rock star.</p>\n<p>The first pool session is typically the most laid back. You take your first breaths underwater, learn how to properly clear your ears and get used to the idea of moving around underwater with all of the equipment. You also learn how to assemble and disassemble your equipment.</p>\n<p>The rest of the pool sessions, of which there are five, cover a bundle of skills as well as practicing what you learned in previous sessions. This is when you learn to clear your mask, what to do if you lose your regulator or you mask, what to do if you run out of air and practice buoyancy control.</p>\n<p>The next step is the open water dives. This is when you get out of the pool and go to a lake, ocean or quarry to do dives in a true underwater environment. Most people that I know got their certification in the tropics where the water is usually a balmy 80 degree. The rest of us, the true divers, go to blue hole or another lake where the water isn&rsquo;t as warm.</p>\n<p>Blue hole is, as the instructors put it, one of the more extreme diving environments that recreational divers dive in. The water is sixty-one degrees. Fahrenheit If you can&rsquo;t imagine what that is like, it is cold. You have to wear a full 7mm wetsuit or a dry suit to avoid getting the hyperthermia. On top of that Santa Rosa NM isn&rsquo;t known for its warm weather in the springtime.</p>\n<p>When we got to the Blue Hole it seemed like it was going to be nice, 60 or 70 degrees, no wind, basically a great diving day. That night we were awoken by gusty winds that continued until the following night. So not only was it about forty degrees out of the water, it was windy. The only plus side to this is that when you entered the water it almost seemed warm, until it seemed cold.</p>\n<p>The first day of diving is three dives. The first dive consists of going down to the platform, which is suspended at about 25 feet, hang out, make sure you can clear your ears and then go on a tour of the Blue Hole. The Blue Hole is an amazing place. It is a bell shaped lake; the top has a smaller diameter then the bottom. The max depth is around eighty feet and it connects to the Carlsbad cavern system. Luckily they have grated off the entrance into the caves to save a lot of divers from their own stupidity. The water is surprisingly clear, until the silt gets churned up, and it is always 61 degrees. Always!</p>\n<p>The second dive is the beginning of the skill checks. You get to do the Giant Stride entry, which is quite a bit of fun, and then head down to the platform. Once there you go around the group demonstrating mask clearing, regulator recovery and clearing, alternate air source use, then you take a slightly deeper tour of the lake. This tour is great because you start to see all of the random stuff that is in Blue Hole, like the cow skull or the clown figurines.</p>\n<p>The third and final dive that day is one of the roughest; this is because you are starting to get tired and because it comes after the lunch break. You get suited up, do the back roll entry and head to the platform. Once there you complete basically the same skills as before but with a few extra parts. The mask clearing in no longer partial but fully flooded, this makes it a little more stressful. You then do a third, deeper, tour of the Blue Hole.</p>\n<p>Once you are done it is time to peel off your wetsuit, load up your equipment and go eat. Most people sleep really good that night. Your body is exhausted and as such doesn&rsquo;t really care about anything but sleeping. The next morning comes too soon and you realize that your wetsuit isn&rsquo;t completely dry.</p>\n<p>Most people put their wetsuit on at the hotel for the second day of diving. Putting on a wetsuit that is dry is a chore of superhuman strength. Putting one on that is damp is a feat that only gods can survive. A damp wetsuit is not just wet, it is clammy. This damp clamminess leads to freezing cold as soon as you get outside.</p>\n<p>Your feet get cold; your hands get cold and not just a little cold, the burning clod that makes your hands not work. This makes putting your equipment together a lot more difficult and makes everyone grumpy. The only plus is that once you get in the water you are immediately toasty warm, for about five minutes.</p>\n<p>This last dive is the hardest to do, you are cold and you know that after the dive you have to drive home. The main skill on this dive is removing your mask, putting it back on your face and then clearing it. It is one of the hardest skills known to man… well maybe not. It is really difficult though. The reason is that the inside of your mask is the last bastion of warmth. Your face is dry under your mask, dry and warm. When you remove your mask you get the shock of cold water on your face and you immediately want to inhale thought your nose. As soon as you do that you forget that you can breathe out of your regulator and head to the surface.</p>\n<p>If you can fight this urge, stay focused, you can complete the skill and are a SCUBA diver. If you panic and surface the instructor or dive master will follow you up, making sure you ascend safely, and if you are ready you can head back down and try again. That is the beauty of SCUBA; you can&rsquo;t fail, you can only quit.</p>\n<p>It is my opinion that everyone should learn to SCUBA dive. It is amazing.

				"content_html": "<p><em>You may have noticed that I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while. That is because I have only recieved two slurpees. Come on. Really it is because my computer is being weird and wordpress isn&rsquo;t posting stuff when it should. I am headed to NM for Sarah&rsquo;s SCUBA certification and will get back to posting regularly on Monday. Happy weekend, buy me slurpees!</em></p>\n<p>It is apparently the time of year in which I start to get frustrated with the current status of my life. I don&rsquo;t know if it is the proximity to the date that I dropped out of UNC and my college life ended or if it is that spring, for what ever reason, makes me sad; but I am currently bummed out.</p>\n<p>Part of the yearly frustration is that my life seems to be on career pause. I have currently worked at Property Technica, for my dad, for longer than I have worked any other job. This depresses me for two reasons: I am working for my dad and property management is slowly killing my soul.</p>\n<p>I want to do something else with my life. I don&rsquo;t know what it is; I just know that I need to do something else with my life. I watch my dad at work- he seems to enjoy it- and I think to myself &ldquo;Is that who I want to be in thirty years? The answer is no.</p>\n<p>So what should I, could I be? That is the question that needs to be answered. When I really think about what I want out of life I realize that I am pretty simple. I don&rsquo;t need fancy things or lots of money. I am perfectly happy living a simple life, in fact I prefer a simple life. Sarah and I have been able to support ourselves quite well without making millions or sometime even thousands of dollars.</p>\n<p>I feel that my strongest abilities are communication, compassion and confidence. The three C&rsquo;s encompass my main strengths and if I could find a job that allows me to use them all, awesome. The problem is finding a job that fits them all.</p>\n<p>My abilities as a communicator allow me to empathize/sympathize with a lot of people. I am able to calm people down when they are angry, convince people to listen to my ideas and generally explain things in a way that is easy to understand.</p>\n<p>Compassion is something that I have for everyone. I try my best to be nice to everyone, unless you work for a cell phone company or a credit card company, and generally want everyone to be happy. I am comfortable around any type of person, whether they are disabled or just an asshole. I realize that no matter who you are you still have to poop.</p>\n<p>Confidence, which in reading this back to myself seems a funny thing to write about having, has allowed me to get to the happy place that I am in my life. I am not afraid of making an ass of myself nor am I afraid that I am going to fail at something important. What I lack is the ability to focus on a task long enough to complete it.</p>\n<p>That simple fact, me not being able to focus, can be traced to my current job. As my boss/dad put it so nicely I have a bad habit of taking on a task, working really hard at it and then giving up when it gets boring or I get distracted.</p>\n<p>I think that the most common problem for me is getting distracted. My mind was not made to focus on one thing for an extended period of time. I have never been and will probably never be that kind of person who plans for the future. That ability doesn&rsquo;t exist inside of me.</p>\n<p>What I am able to do is focus on the now. There are few situations that I am not able to react to. The jobs that I have worked that I have received the most enjoyment out of have been unpredictable jobs. Lifeguarding was a wonderful experience for me. I learned how to act in an emergency and was able to save lives.  I learned that I don&rsquo;t mind blood as long as it isn&rsquo;t mine.</p>\n<p>Other jobs I have had have taught me how to handle different people in different situations. What they haven&rsquo;t taught me is how to leverage this experience into a career.</p>\n<p>I decided, about a week ago, to look into paramedic school. The thinking was that a paramedic is a super life guard, I would be helping people and the job is somewhat unpredictable. I had even gone to an orientation for the summer classes so that I would be a paramedic by the fall. I was starting to get excited.</p>\n<p>Then the bottom dropped out. That might be a lot over dramatic but whatever. As I have not mentioned before, Sarah and I are going on a cruise this summer to celebrate our five year anniversary.

				"content_text": "\n_You may have noticed that I haven't posted in a while. That is because I have only recieved two slurpees. Come on. Really it is because my computer is being weird and wordpress isn't posting stuff when it should. I am headed to NM for Sarah's SCUBA certification and will get back to posting regularly on Monday. Happy weekend, buy me slurpees!_\n\nIt is apparently the time of year in which I start to get frustrated with the current status of my life. I don't know if it is the proximity to the date that I dropped out of UNC and my college life ended or if it is that spring, for what ever reason, makes me sad; but I am currently bummed out.\n\nPart of the yearly frustration is that my life seems to be on career pause. I have currently worked at Property Technica, for my dad, for longer than I have worked any other job. This depresses me for two reasons: I am working for my dad and property management is slowly killing my soul.\n\nI want to do something else with my life. I don't know what it is; I just know that I need to do something else with my life. I watch my dad at work- he seems to enjoy it- and I think to myself \"Is that who I want to be in thirty years? The answer is no.\n\nSo what should I, could I be? That is the question that needs to be answered. When I really think about what I want out of life I realize that I am pretty simple. I don't need fancy things or lots of money. I am perfectly happy living a simple life, in fact I prefer a simple life. Sarah and I have been able to support ourselves quite well without making millions or sometime even thousands of dollars.\n\nI feel that my strongest abilities are communication, compassion and confidence. The three C's encompass my main strengths and if I could find a job that allows me to use them all, awesome. The problem is finding a job that fits them all.\n\nMy abilities as a communicator allow me to empathize/sympathize with a lot of people. I am able to calm people down when they are angry, convince people to listen to my ideas and generally explain things in a way that is easy to understand.\n\nCompassion is something that I have for everyone. I try my best to be nice to everyone, unless you work for a cell phone company or a credit card company, and generally want everyone to be happy. I am comfortable around any type of person, whether they are disabled or just an asshole. I realize that no matter who you are you still have to poop.\n\nConfidence, which in reading this back to myself seems a funny thing to write about having, has allowed me to get to the happy place that I am in my life. I am not afraid of making an ass of myself nor am I afraid that I am going to fail at something important. What I lack is the ability to focus on a task long enough to complete it.\n\nThat simple fact, me not being able to focus, can be traced to my current job. As my boss/dad put it so nicely I have a bad habit of taking on a task, working really hard at it and then giving up when it gets boring or I get distracted.\n\nI think that the most common problem for me is getting distracted. My mind was not made to focus on one thing for an extended period of time. I have never been and will probably never be that kind of person who plans for the future. That ability doesn't exist inside of me.\n\nWhat I am able to do is focus on the now. There are few situations that I am not able to react to. The jobs that I have worked that I have received the most enjoyment out of have been unpredictable jobs. Lifeguarding was a wonderful experience for me. I learned how to act in an emergency and was able to save lives.  I learned that I don't mind blood as long as it isn't mine.\n\nOther jobs I have had have taught me how to handle different people in different situations. What they haven't taught me is how to leverage this experience into a career.\n\nI decided, about a week ago, to look into paramedic school. The thinking was that a paramedic is a super life guard, I would be helping people and the job is somewhat unpredictable. I had even gone to an orientation for the summer classes so that I would be a paramedic by the fall. I was starting to get excited.\n\nThen the bottom dropped out. That might be a lot over dramatic but whatever. As I have not mentioned before, Sarah and I are going on a cruise this summer to celebrate our five year anniversary. I am super excited, not only for the cruise but because Sarah is learning to SCUBA dive, and can't wait for the trip to start.\n\nThe trip just happens to be during the first week of summer classes. This would cause me to miss the first two paramedic classes and one of the labs. I figured that a quick email to the instructor explaining what was going on and why I would miss the classes would make it ok for me to miss those days.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI received a very short email reply stating that students are only allowed to miss one day the whole semester and that I would be unable to take the class. I understand that they obviously have policies in place to back them up on this; I just think that this was a little bit, well a lot a bit of bull shit.\n\nI was nice enough to send her an email about me missing the class. I explained that the trip was booked well in advance and that I would be missing the classes. I even stated that I would be happy to do any reading and assignments early so that I would be ready when I got back.\n\nStill a no.

I find it funny that at the orientation that I went to, that had all of two people interested in the EMT program, they never mentioned the attendance policy.

I would politely explain to the person who hired me that I would be on a trip during the time that they wanted me to start. Lo and behold, they let me keep the job.\n\nThat, in a rather larger nutshell is why I am frustrated. I thought I was going to be able to get this training and escape a job that makes me crazy by August. Alas it is not to be.\n\nThe content part is easier. Sarah and I are really starting to get things figured out. We have a budget in place, which we follow (mostly), Sarah started SCUBA diving, which makes me happy and I am rediscovering my love of recreational diving.\n\nYes I don't get to become an EMT this summer, but plan B is in full effect.

On top of that you could be digitizing another image while the other one is embroidering.

I figure that the \"set up\" involves putting thread on the machine, digitizing the image, adding a hat and pressing go. Really? Doing all of that can't take more than 15 minutes. On top of that you could be digitizing another image while the other one is embroidering. In order to get all of my designs done I would have to pay $160 for about an hour of his time on top of the cost of embroidering. Really!\n\nThis is like me charging $80 for the time it takes me to put on my makeup on top of the rate for the party. Seems sleazy to me though I am sure it is a common practice for print makers and embroiderizers. Sorry print makers I just threw you in there for fun, I love your work.\n\nI could understand the \"set up\" fee if you actually had to set something up. Being a person that sews I know that threading a needle isn't that difficult. And after using my mom's embroidering sewing machine I know that you just push the pedal and go. So what needs to be \"set up\" your coffee?\n\nSo unless all of the readers of this blog want a hat, for $15-$20 a hat, I will have to file this away with my other pipe dreams. If you would like one, let me know. They are going to be awesome. \n",

This pressure made it impossible to sell the fur and created a public outcry against the practice of wearing seal fur garments.</p>\n<pre><code>        Sharks have a more uphill battle since showing a baby shark to someone does not provide the warm fuzzy feeling that one might get when seeing a baby seal, but the same international pressure would help the shark. If the United States and her allies started to apply pressure to the countries that are the primary users of shark products, the same result could happen.  It could lead to Japan and China signing the shark fishing ban and allow the shark a chance to bounce back.\n\n        Stiffer fishing regulations would also serve to help sharks as well as other ocean predators that are hurt by long line and drift net fishing. This would be the same type of regulation that keeps canned tuna fish dolphin-safe. We need to start making seafood producers realize that as consumers we do not want to hurt the sharks when we buy sea food. I would love to see cans of tuna that say they are dolphin AND shark safe. \n\n        The third part of the solution is to start researching the habits of sharks. Scientists know very little about the mating habits of sharks. This means that if they wanted to raise sharks in a controlled setting to reintroduce them, like the gray wolf, they would be unable to because we have never gotten them to mate in a controlled setting. By all accounts some sharks only mate every two years. This means that it will take a while to get the populations restarted. If we were able to have populations started in aquariums we would be able to provide a much needed boost to the shark population through reintroduction.\n\n        Other actions that would help sharks bounce back would be to have a shark fishing season. Having a time of year that it is legal to fish sharks would allow fishermen to get a viable catch while allowing sharks time to recover their population. Since there is little known about sharks mating habits, picking the right time of year might be difficult but with a little more research scientists should be able to pick a season that would be best for sharks.\n\n        Another important step to saving the shark is to find an alternative means of acquiring the cartilage needed. The cartilage used in a lot of the supplements could just as easily come from cows or sheep. For marketing purposes I can see the beauty of marketing sharks; they are powerful and amazing creatures, but I think that it would be easier to get cartilage from an animal that is raised in ranches around the world.\n\n        The final idea for saving the sharks is to research how to farm sharks. There are certain breeds of sharks that are smaller and more docile then the stereotypical killer shark. These sharks would be easier to farm and they would be less likely to eat each other.

Living in pain is when you let your pain control your life. This is just like when you have to live somewhere that you don't want. Like Nebraska. No one wants to live in Nebraska, if someone says they do they are lying. If you find yourself altering major parts of your life because of your pain you are living in pain. Stop. Think about little things you can do to adjust your life.\n\nSimple things can be done to make your pain more manageable while allowing you to continue to do the things that you love. Maybe going to a Yoga class or a Sit and Be Fit class will allow you to move better. Getting yourself more mobile will help you do any activities that you miss doing or you have stopped doing. Please if you are living in pain, try switching. Living with pain is so much better.\n",

This destructive industry could be changed with some creative aquaculture. Aquaculture is the practice of farming fish in the ocean. It should be possible to farm sharks in this manner allowing for a controlled population to be fished instead of the accidental catch that is the primary way that sharks are caught currently. This would also allow regulation on the size of sharks captured as well as provide a research are for studying sharks.\n\n        This kind of fishing would probably work best with some of the smaller species of shark. This would allow for more of them to be kept in a similar area and allow for a good ratio of cartilage to fin so that the whole shark is being used.\n\n        One thing to keep in mind about shark cartilage is that sharks do get cancer and there has been no proof that shark cartilage has any affect of cancer at all. Most of the uses of shark cartilage could be replaced with the cartilage from a cow, a much more abundant and easy to find creature. Sure, it does not seem as cool to be taking cow cartilage pills, but it sure is better for the environment.\n\n        All of the supposed medical uses for shark cartilage need much more research support. There have been no conclusive studies that say that shark cartilage has a benefit to the human body. It seems that just like with the dangerousness of sharks the health benefits  have been exaggerated by the media.\n\n        From the data it would appear that sharks are as dangerous as their reputation. It is not surprising that people have been hurt by sharks. They are kings of the ocean. If a person goes into the shark's domain they must accept the risk of encountering them and that encounter will go how the shark wants it to.  According to Peter Klimley of the University of California at Davis, &quot;We once took a seal and stripped the fat off it and put it all in the water. The shark ate the fat but not the rest of the body. They are actually very discriminating predators&quot; (Benson 2).\n\n        Why then, if they are man-eaters, did they swim away? Because of optimal foraging theory, a mathematical explanation of how sharks and other predators weigh the caloric value of prey against the cost to eat it (Martin 3). A shark would not interested in eating something as lean and stringy as a human being. People that eat meat need to think about which they would rather eat, a groundhog or a cow. Personally, I would eat the cow any day. Cows are slower, have a higher fat content which can be converted into energy and I can buy steak at the store making it the easier of the two to get. Sharks are the same way. A shark is not going to eat a person if a seal or tuna fish is available. To a shark a human is like celery; it takes more work to eat it then the energy gained from the eating. \n\n        Most people attacked by sharks are attacked because to a shark they looked and acted like a seal in an area where the shark was hunting. A swimming person from below looks like an injured seal. An injured seal is an easy fatty snack for a shark. A surfer looks like a seal resting at the surface of the water. The shark just does what it would do if it saw a tasty morsel floating above it. The shark swam up, grabbed the surfer and pulled him under. The shark would once again be surprised by the lack of sealness once it got the person underwater releasing the surfer and swimming away. As Rob Stewart, director of the documentary on shark finning, Sharkwater, said &quot;The reality is that sharks are not dangerous predators to humans. If people realize that, they'll care about them the same way as they do about pandas and elephants and bears. When an elephant is killed for ivory in Africa, the world goes crazy. But millions of sharks get killed in a year, and no one notices or cares&quot; (Sharkwater).\n\n        Looking through more and more cases of shark &quot;attacks&quot;  it becomes apparent that most of them were a case of mistaken identity. One rarely reads about a SCUBA diver being attacked. This is because SCUBA equipment is loud and the divers cannot be mistaken for another animal in the sea. Nothing moves like a SCUBA diver in the water or makes as much noise. Since sound travels four times faster underwater then it does in air, sharks hear the racket that people make and typically investigate. They do not attack, they just swim by, maybe bumping into the people but rarely use their mouths to check divers out as they do other creatures.\n\n        Not only is there less danger from sharks than there is from lightning but they share the predatory patterns with one of the most beloved of all sea creatures. The orca, or killer whale, is one of the most well known marine mammals. They are famous at Sea World and other marine parks and very few people are afraid of them. Here is an animal that shares the slot of apex predator with the white shark and yet is not feared the same way. One has to think that if an orca took a bite at someone they would basically be eaten. One does not hear about it because whoever was attacked would be gone, completely eaten.\n\n        To give an idea of how dangerous orcas are let me tell a story from my days at commercial diving school. I had an instructor for one of my classes named Scott Cassell. Scott is one of those crazy underwater people. He spends his time filming dangerous creatures underwater. He has developed numerous tools to allow him to dive with creatures that very few others will dive with. He told us, &quot;If you are in the water to work and you see a white shark not to worry. If you see a tiger shark you'll be fine, but if you see an orca get the fuck out of the water.&quot;\n\n        Here is a man who has logged more than five thousand hours underwater, with most of that spent diving in dangerous environments and with dangerous creatures and he will not dive with orcas. And yet these orcas are protected while an animal that has simply gotten a bad reputation from movies and books remains in danger of being fished to extinction.  \n</code></pre>\n",

Yep, it&rsquo;s true, Dungeons and Dragons holds the key to saving money and paying off your debt. Here are some tips on saving money that any table top RPG playing nerd could teach you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Loot everything- This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have to kill everything and then take all of its stuff. No, what you need to do is look for the financial gain in everything. This means taking a look at everything you do and seeing what else you can gain. Maybe this means putting your money in a higher interest bearing account or ordering the free checks instead of the ones covered in chromatic dragons. Consider saving money to be looting from yourself, which is ideal since looting from your friends is not cool. Save as much as you can so you can afford a +1 budget that will allow you to slay your debt.</li>\n<li>Everyone is trying to poison you- I&rsquo;m not kidding, even your friends are trying to poison you. This means that you can only eat food that you have prepared. Sure if you trust your significant other they can prepare your food, but do you really trust them? If you make your food choices based on the assumption that anything you haven&rsquo;t prepared could be poisoned, killing you, you will be more inclined to eat food you prepare. The nice thing about food you have prepared yourself is that it is cheaper. A lot cheaper.</li>\n<li>Search for traps- When you get offers in the mail for credit, get a loan or borrow money from anyone, READ THE FINE PRINT. Reading the fine print won&rsquo;t kill you and you will learn the terms of the loan and find any potential traps. Traps that you will find might be an acceleration clause or maybe a change in your interest rate if you pay late. Trust me a 3d6 A.P.R. adjustment will kill you as surely as a fireball. Keep in mind that a trapped door or loan is going to do its best to not look trapped.</li>\n<li>Invest in +1 budget- Do this as soon as you can. You wouldn&rsquo;t enter a dungeon without the proper equipment and a +1 budget will allow you to fight off even the hardest temptations. A +1 budget gives you a bonus on Will saves to avoid stress shopping and a +1 to Fortitude saves against pushy sales people. Make sure that your budget does allow for the occasional shopping trip. You need it.</li>\n<li>Find a good party- Just as a good party needs a Cleric, Wizard, Fighter and Rogue, a good financial plan needs someone to fill all those roles. The Cleric can help staunch the bleeding that is your current financial crisis, the wizard will work his magic to enchant your budget, the Fighter is responsible for keeping the spending monster at bay and the Rogue is in charge of finding good deals and of course picking pockets.</li>\n<li>Everything is treasure- Everything is and should be for sale. If you have found something that you could sell and it is free, take it and sell it. Do this quickly before someone else does. Never underestimate the value of something you would donate to a thrift store. Sure it might be nice to donate to the less fortunate but if you are going to get your finances under control you need to sell everything. Even better try to sell it without having to split the gold with your party. Splitting treasure is for pussies.</li>\n<li>Save for healing potions- You wouldn&rsquo;t go fight a dragon without buying a few extra healing potions. Of course if you spend all your gold on super fancy armor and a bunch of weapons how are you going to buy the potions? Always set aside a little gold for the future. That way you will never be surprised when you run into a monster of the emergency variety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are wondering how one creates a +1 budget I would suggest that you start with one of the spreadsheets below. They are pretty easy to use. You just fill in what you make, what your monthly expenses are, your debt and what things you are planning on buying in the next year. Once you do that you need to figure out what you can pay for each bill. Start with the smallest balance and work your way to the most expensive. You can see that there are two sheets. Both use the same numbers and you pay off all of your credit card debt in the same month but with the savings plan you have $380 in savings the same month you paid it off and $2810 in savings in a year.</p>\n<p>If you have questions please let me know and I will do my best to help. I am not saying that I am the best financial planner but I am pretty good at making budgets. Good luck and remember, when you are needing help in life look no further than your local gaming group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/2009/03/legendary-budget.xls\">Pre-Office 2007</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/media/2009/03/legendary-budget.xlsx\">Office 2007</a></p>\n",

It seems that in order to qualify for the monthly payment reduction you have to be behind on your payments. WHAT!?! This makes no sense to me. If they are going to reduce your payments you still have to make those payments. If someone can&rsquo;t make a $1600 to $2000 payment what is to say that they are going to be able to make a $800 or $1000 payment. Not only that but the people that qualify for this plan get a $5000 reduction to their principle if they make there payments on time.</p>\n<p>I do think that we need to help people, but helping people who made poor financial decisions and not helping those that made good financial decisions is wrong. Why should people who bought a house within their means, read the loans fine print and make their payments be punished by having to continue to pay the full amount of their loan. I would love it if out mortgage payment was reduced from its current amount to three quarters of that amount. I would also love to have the principle on our loan reduced by $5000. $5000 is equal to more then 6 months of not having to make payments. In fact that would almost make our rate 0% instead of the reasonable rate we currently have.</p>\n<p>Sure it sucks that people are losing their homes but all of those people are adults who are responsible for contracts that they sign. I find it hard to believe that people  where surprised by their mortgage payment doubled. If people did not read the contracts they where signing, that isn&rsquo;t the person who wrote the contracts fault. If in fact the contract contained illegal parts, then sure, they people should get help. But if everything in the contract is legal why should they get help and people who aren&rsquo;t in a bind get no help?</p>\n<p>I just think that the USA is setting a dangerous attitude of taking responsibility for people making poor decisions. What about people who lose their jobs due to negligence on their part and can&rsquo;t pay their mortgage. Should the government fix that problem too? Foreclosure sucks but is it really the government&rsquo;s job to fix peoples poor decisions?</p>\n<p>I will admit that I have a selfish reason for feeling this way. I want my mortgage payment to go down. Not because I can&rsquo;t afford it. not because my rate has sky-rocketed, but because everyone was created equal so we should all be treated the same.

				"title": "Things Change",
				"content_html": "<p>Things happen. It is a part of life. What is important is not what happens but how you react. Take Sarah and I for instance. We have been together for nine years and married for a little over four years. During this time we have faced me getting laid off, Sarah getting really sick, then getting some weird skin thing and then a blood clot. Through all of these things, which happened in the second year we where married, we rolled with the punches. We have been through things in our first two years married that most couples don&rsquo;t go through. Here is what I have learned:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t be to ready.</strong> You can&rsquo;t be ready for everything. I would love to tell you that you can prepare for any eventuality, but you can&rsquo;t. What this means is that you shouldn&rsquo;t try to be prepared for everything. In fact I would suggest avoiding preparations altogether. When Sarah and I went through all of out stuff we where young, without savings and neither of us where making very much money and yet we where still able to make it. The trick is to live within your means. Don&rsquo;t go crazy, don&rsquo;t buy a $200,000 home when a $130,000 home will do. The same goes for renting. Figure out what you can afford not what you want. Do you need a new car or will a used one do? This is simple and yet so many people don&rsquo;t think about what they can afford instead buying what they want.</li>\n<li><strong>Roll with it.</strong> Seriously. This is the best advice I can give any couple. When things happen, what ever they are, just go with it. Lets say, for example, one of you ends up in the hospital three times in one year and you rack up $25,000 in debt to the hospital. On top of that one of you can&rsquo;t work because they are sick and the one that can work only makes $20,000 a year. Take a deep breath, smile and get ready to work. The first thing to do is take care of the person who is sick. That should be priority one. After that call all creditors and explain the situation. Express that you will do you best to pay but make sure they understand what is going on. If there is a month when you can&rsquo;t pay a creditor call them ASAP and let them know.  Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help. Hopefully you will qualify for some sort of financial assistance from the hospital, but if you don&rsquo;t just take a deep breath and smile.</li>\n<li><strong>Adjust.</strong> Adjust your life to fit the new situation. If I have learned anything from Sarah and I&rsquo;s troubles it is the importance of adjust little things to make your life better. Simple things like renting movies or learning to make your own ice cream can save you money. An even better idea then renting movies is to borrow movies from friends. If a doctor tells you that you might feel better if you adjusted your diet, try it. It costs you very little to try something and you may find that cutting out all the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; food will make you feel a lot better. Keep in mind that doctors aren&rsquo;t always right and you may make adjustments to a prescribed diet.</li>\n<li><strong>Be a team.</strong> This probably should have been number one. The one thing that Sarah and I do that has helped us through so much is act as a team. We have one joint checking account and one joint savings account. We talk to each other about purchases as well as work together paying the bills. Sarah is definitely better at managing money then I, but it isn&rsquo;t fair for her to be solely responsible for our finances. Being a team goes for everything. It is both of your jobs to support the other in all of their endeavors. This means that if your significant other likes to read horror comics and play video games or <em>gasp</em> plays dungeons and dragons, you support that. If on the other hand your significant other is a huge art dork and needs help preparing for the classes she teaches, you are right there lending a hand. Sure you may not really care about what they are interested in, but is it that hard to help them out?</li>\n<li><strong>Be awesome.</strong> This is truly the most important part of any relationship. Being awesome is pretty simple. In fact the person you are with probably already thinks your awesome. So just continue being who you are. Of course part of being awesome is accepting the other persons awesomeness. For instance, I think that Sarah is awesome because she knows so much about art, isn&rsquo;t afraid of very much and puts up with all my crap. Sarah is awesome. Think about your significant other, what do you think is awesome? Ask them what they think is awesome about you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is my theory on being happy and having a happy life together. Sure it isn&rsquo;t perfect but then nothing really is. That is another thing to keep in mind. We are all not perfect. This is probably a good description of all relationships. They aren&rsquo;t perfect and striving for perfection can only make it worse. The important thing is to love each other and remember: Your a Team.</p>\n",

The one thing that Sarah and I do that has helped us through so much is act as a team. We have one joint checking account and one joint savings account. We talk to each other about purchases as well as work together paying the bills. Sarah is definitely better at managing money then I, but it isn't fair for her to be solely responsible for our finances. Being a team goes for everything. It is both of your jobs to support the other in all of their endeavors. This means that if your significant other likes to read horror comics and play video games or *gasp* plays dungeons and dragons, you support that. If on the other hand your significant other is a huge art dork and needs help preparing for the classes she teaches, you are right there lending a hand. Sure you may not really care about what they are interested in, but is it that hard to help them out?\n  5. **Be awesome.** This is truly the most important part of any relationship. Being awesome is pretty simple. In fact the person you are with probably already thinks your awesome. So just continue being who you are. Of course part of being awesome is accepting the other persons awesomeness. For instance, I think that Sarah is awesome because she knows so much about art, isn't afraid of very much and puts up with all my crap. Sarah is awesome. Think about your significant other, what do you think is awesome? Ask them what they think is awesome about you.\n  \n\n\n  \nThis is my theory on being happy and having a happy life together. Sure it isn't perfect but then nothing really is. That is another thing to keep in mind. We are all not perfect. This is probably a good description of all relationships. They aren't perfect and striving for perfection can only make it worse. The important thing is to love each other and remember: Your a Team.\n",

I have done my best to scare people by talking about ways in which a person can die underwater. While it is true there are a number of ways that one can become injured or even die while SCUBA diving the instances of this are rare, especially within the recreational diving community. I thought that today I would tell you about why SCUBA diving is so awesome.</p>\n<p>To start with, SCUBA diving is one of the few recreational sports that requires extensive training just to participate. This means that every SCUBA diver, at one point or another, really wanted to learn how. You run into very few SCUBA divers who decided to learn on a whim or did it just because someone took them. You cannot even rent equipment without being certified.  I think this is important because it puts everyone on the same page and makes sure everyone is on the same page safety wise.</p>\n<p>The beauty of SCUBA training is that it isn&rsquo;t difficult. Sure there are a few concepts that can be confusing, like buoyancy and pressure, but for the most part if you have taken a science class at any point in your life you will be fine. I took my first SCUBA class when I was twelve years old and had no problem understanding the basics and passing with no problems. If I could pass the class when I was twelve there is no reason why anyone else should have a problem.</p>\n<p>Another reason why SCUBA diving is awesome is that it allows you to visit a place where human beings one hundred percent don&rsquo;t belong. In the water you are a visitor and an explorer. It is basically like going to space, but more exciting because there is life underwater. This can be a humbling experience at first. As humans we tend to feel like we are masters of everything we see. Going underwater and seeing that there is a whole world that we don&rsquo;t belong to is incredible.</p>\n<p>I remember on one of my first ocean dives I saw the most incredible animals. About seventy-five feet away flying across the sand was a spotted eagle ray. Here was an animal that was easily as big as I was and it could care less that we where in the water. I am sure that if we would have tried to approach it, there could have been trouble but since we respected the fact that we where visiting, it left us alone.</p>\n<p>The most important aspect of SCUBA is that it raises peoples awareness about the oceans and inland waterway environments. When you start to dive you learn all about how to dive and what you should and shouldn&rsquo;t do. What is interesting is that most new divers start researching what creatures they might see underwater and in doing so learn about conservation efforts.

				"content_html": "<p>Recently, at work, I was asked to figure out new, cheap means of marketing in this fantastic economy. While marketing has always been a fascination of mine I am a little stressed out about finding cheap viable marketing options. We are currently using craigslist and a few other free marketing websites, but so is everybody else. What I need is a good way to get the word out and that way has to be cheap.</p>\n<p>My immediate thought was to start a corporate blog. I could post once or twice a week with tips and tricks to being a good tenant. The only problem I see with this is that I would end up being the one doing the writing. Since I have been updating this blog as much as I have, I am trying to limit gaining other blog commitments. Especially ones that won&rsquo;t pay me additional money.

				"content_text": "\nRecently, at work, I was asked to figure out new, cheap means of marketing in this fantastic economy. While marketing has always been a fascination of mine I am a little stressed out about finding cheap viable marketing options. We are currently using craigslist and a few other free marketing websites, but so is everybody else. What I need is a good way to get the word out and that way has to be cheap. \n\nMy immediate thought was to start a corporate blog. I could post once or twice a week with tips and tricks to being a good tenant. The only problem I see with this is that I would end up being the one doing the writing. Since I have been updating this blog as much as I have, I am trying to limit gaining other blog commitments. Especially ones that won't pay me additional money.

One of my favorite parts of that game was the really long story/quest mode.</p>\n<p>The story mode in Street Fighter IV is nothing like this mode. Of course it isn&rsquo;t a story mode; it is an arcade mode, an arcade mode that punishes me. My first attempt at arcade mode ended in frustration. This happened because the computer cheats.

The backgrounds are all fun, with people moving around and cheering, not so much that it is distracting but enough that it makes for some entertainment when they computer is kicking your ass.</p>\n<p>The AI in this game is ridiculously good. I think that the developer modeled it after that kid in the arcade that could play all day on one quarter taking on anyone and everyone that challenged him.

I now understand what he was able to do what he has done and why he was able to do it. He loves computers. He has been playing around with computers forever and has finally found people crazy enough to pay him bundles of money to do just that.<br>\nSince I realized this I have putting a lot of thought into what I love doing and how I can do that to make money. Here are the things I love:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>-Clowning</li>\n<li>-Crafting</li>\n<li>-Diving</li>\n<li>-Video Games</li>\n<li>-Comics</li>\n<li>-Writing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above list is probably not complete or is it in any order except the order that I thought of them. I am going to go through, look at each one, and see which one strikes me as the one I like best.</p>\n<p>**Clowning- **Clowning is something that I have been doing for over ten years and I love doing it. My favorite type of clowning is doing volunteer clown jobs. I do four or five of them a year and I am always a big hit. The problem with doing jobs volunteer style is that the pay sucks. I have thought in the past about trying to charge the non-profits that I work with to do these jobs, but since I have done it free for almost ten years that hardly seems fair or nice.</p>\n<p>The one part of clowning that I do not enjoy is the booking process. I have yet to find a way of booking that works well for me. I have tried numerous methods and just kind find the magic bullet booking plan. I am also not a fan of waiting for the phone to ring and having to sell myself to customers. I think that this problem stems from the fact that I hate the competitive aspect of entertaining. I want to be friends and cooperate with my fellow entertainers and not all entertainers are interested in having that type of relationship.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting-</strong> I started sewing when my mom and I made me some shorts when I was about twelve. Actually, it may have been earlier, I do not really remember. I love sewing, especially making my Awesome Guys, and enjoy the since of accomplishment that comes from finishing a hard project.</p>\n<p>Once again I do not really enjoy the selling part of crafting. So far, I have done most of my selling via Etsy, which allows me avoid the hard sell on people I can actually see. I do not enjoy that the most common way to sell your items on Etsy is to spam the forums with your items to get bundles of people to look at your items. There has to be a better way but I have not found it yet.</p>\n<p>The best part of crafting is that it provides a creative outlet and gives you a very tangible product. I do wish that the Awesome Guys sold a little better, but their lack of sales doesn&rsquo;t diminish how much fun I had making them.</p>\n<p><strong>Diving-</strong> When I learned to SCUBA dive all I wanted to do was dive. I was interested in becoming a Master Diver and possibly working as a diver somewhere. This went along with my dream of becoming a Marine Biologist. Unfortunately, I was not very dedicated to the science side of marine biology and so my kept learning more and more about the diving side of things.</p>\n<p>What I love about SCUBA is that it combines the relaxation of being suspended in space with the adventure of exploring the unknown. I wish that I had more time and money to spend on SCUBA so that I could dive more often. Luckily, I own all my own equipment, which means that when someone wants to dive I am ready to go at a moments notice. In addition, not having to rent anything really keeps the prices down on dive trips.</p>\n<p>The only problem is that SCUBA is a buddy sport. You have to have a buddy to do it safely and I unfortunately have written too often on the dangers of SCUBA and scared Sarah away from it. Recently I have been fortunate enough to find a person who is interested in doing some diving and may have a dive buddy in the near future. We shall see.</p>\n<p>The real bummer about SCUBA is that I spent a year diving for school/jobs and that took some of the shiny veneer off the sport. It was no longer an amazing thing that I got to do; it was something I had to do. I still loved it but it no longer felt special. It has, however, been a number of years since I &ldquo;had&rdquo; to dive and I am hoping that diving this summer will give me an opportunity to fall in love with recreational diving again.</p>\n<p><strong>Video Games-</strong> Who doesn&rsquo;t love video games? I am sure there is someone out there who does not like them, but they are crazy. I love playing video games. I have always had a secret interest in making a video game but I am not interested in taking the time to learn how to do it.</p>\n<p>This feeling most likely comes from when I tried to teach myself php. I was able to learn very little and ended up frustrated and annoyed with the whole idea. I could probably learn easier if I where to take a class but since I am not necessarily interested spending my life behind a computer screen I do not feel it is important to learn programming languages.</p>\n<p><strong>Comics-</strong> I have recently started reading comic books again. This combined with my love of web-comics means that I spend a lot of time each week reading comics. Currently I am reading Hack/Slash, Grimm&rsquo;s Fairytales, Ultimate Spiderman and Army of Darkness in the real world. The funny thing about the comic books that I read is that they are almost all horror comics, which is weird since I hate horror movies. Online I real<a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/\">Penny Arcade</a>, <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/\">XKCD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pvponline.com/\">PvP</a>,<a href=\"http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/latest\"> Looking for Group</a> and <a href=\"http://cad-comic.com/comic.php\">Ctrl-Alt-Del</a>. Unlike the comic books, almost all of my web comics are about the gaming culture.</p>\n<p>If I were better at drawing, I would probably try to start a web comic, mostly because I have enjoyed reading other peoples so much and feel that I have a lot of fun stuff crammed into my head</p>\n<p><strong>Writing-</strong> When I decided that I wanted to write a children&rsquo;s book a floodgate has opened. Between this blog, my other <a href=\"http://clownusability.com/\">blog</a> and my notebooks I am probably writing for an hour or two a day. All I need to do is figure out how to be paid to do all of that writing. I find writing to be relaxing and an amazing way to clear my mind. I find that on the days I do the most writing I sleep so much better.</p>\n<p>One other benefit of writing everyday is that it seems to work as a jump drive for my brain. I am able to store information somewhere else letting me cram more information into my brain. I assume that this is helping me do better in school.</p>\n<p>I was hoping that by writing all of this stuff about my hobbies that I would be able to pick one that I liked most over the rest. Unfortunately, what has happened is that I have realized how much I enjoy all of these things. Apparently, I will need to do more thinking about which one I like best. Or I could just pick one.</p>\n",

I am also not a fan of waiting for the phone to ring and having to sell myself to customers. I think that this problem stems from the fact that I hate the competitive aspect of entertaining. I want to be friends and cooperate with my fellow entertainers and not all entertainers are interested in having that type of relationship.\n\n**Crafting-** I started sewing when my mom and I made me some shorts when I was about twelve. Actually, it may have been earlier, I do not really remember. I love sewing, especially making my Awesome Guys, and enjoy the since of accomplishment that comes from finishing a hard project.\n\nOnce again I do not really enjoy the selling part of crafting. So far, I have done most of my selling via Etsy, which allows me avoid the hard sell on people I can actually see. I do not enjoy that the most common way to sell your items on Etsy is to spam the forums with your items to get bundles of people to look at your items. There has to be a better way but I have not found it yet.\n\nThe best part of crafting is that it provides a creative outlet and gives you a very tangible product. I do wish that the Awesome Guys sold a little better, but their lack of sales doesn't diminish how much fun I had making them.\n\n**Diving-** When I learned to SCUBA dive all I wanted to do was dive. I was interested in becoming a Master Diver and possibly working as a diver somewhere. This went along with my dream of becoming a Marine Biologist. Unfortunately, I was not very dedicated to the science side of marine biology and so my kept learning more and more about the diving side of things.\n\nWhat I love about SCUBA is that it combines the relaxation of being suspended in space with the adventure of exploring the unknown. I wish that I had more time and money to spend on SCUBA so that I could dive more often. Luckily, I own all my own equipment, which means that when someone wants to dive I am ready to go at a moments notice. In addition, not having to rent anything really keeps the prices down on dive trips.\n\nThe only problem is that SCUBA is a buddy sport. You have to have a buddy to do it safely and I unfortunately have written too often on the dangers of SCUBA and scared Sarah away from it. Recently I have been fortunate enough to find a person who is interested in doing some diving and may have a dive buddy in the near future. We shall see.\n\nThe real bummer about SCUBA is that I spent a year diving for school/jobs and that took some of the shiny veneer off the sport. It was no longer an amazing thing that I got to do; it was something I had to do. I still loved it but it no longer felt special. It has, however, been a number of years since I \"had\" to dive and I am hoping that diving this summer will give me an opportunity to fall in love with recreational diving again.\n\n**Video Games-** Who doesn't love video games? I am sure there is someone out there who does not like them, but they are crazy. I love playing video games. I have always had a secret interest in making a video game but I am not interested in taking the time to learn how to do it.\n\nThis feeling most likely comes from when I tried to teach myself php. I was able to learn very little and ended up frustrated and annoyed with the whole idea. I could probably learn easier if I where to take a class but since I am not necessarily interested spending my life behind a computer screen I do not feel it is important to learn programming languages.\n\n**Comics-** I have recently started reading comic books again. This combined with my love of web-comics means that I spend a lot of time each week reading comics. Currently I am reading Hack/Slash, Grimm's Fairytales, Ultimate Spiderman and Army of Darkness in the real world. The funny thing about the comic books that I read is that they are almost all horror comics, which is weird since I hate horror movies. Online I real[Penny Arcade][1], [XKCD][2], [PvP][3],[ Looking for Group][4] and [Ctrl-Alt-Del][5]. Unlike the comic books, almost all of my web comics are about the gaming culture.\n\n   [1]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/\n   [2]: http://xkcd.com/\n   [3]: http://www.pvponline.com/\n   [4]: http://www.lfgcomic.com/page/latest\n   [5]: http://cad-comic.com/comic.php\n\nIf I were better at drawing, I would probably try to start a web comic, mostly because I have enjoyed reading other peoples so much and feel that I have a lot of fun stuff crammed into my head\n\n**Writing-** When I decided that I wanted to write a children's book a floodgate has opened. Between this blog, my other [blog][6] and my notebooks I am probably writing for an hour or two a day. All I need to do is figure out how to be paid to do all of that writing. I find writing to be relaxing and an amazing way to clear my mind. I find that on the days I do the most writing I sleep so much better.\n\n   [6]: http://clownusability.com/\n\nOne other benefit of writing everyday is that it seems to work as a jump drive for my brain. I am able to store information somewhere else letting me cram more information into my brain. I assume that this is helping me do better in school.\n\nI was hoping that by writing all of this stuff about my hobbies that I would be able to pick one that I liked most over the rest. Unfortunately, what has happened is that I have realized how much I enjoy all of these things. Apparently, I will need to do more thinking about which one I like best. Or I could just pick one.\n\n \n",

				"title": "The Truth About Sharks and Fishing",
				"content_html": "<p>Sharks are one of the greatest mysteries of the world today. We probably know more about the moon then we do about sharks. This is primarily caused by the fact that as a group sharks are as varied as people are. For instance, the white shark, commonly known as the great white shark, travels thousands of miles every year. A single great white shark can encircle the globe hundreds of times in its lifetime.</p>\n<pre><code>        Shark attacks are exploratory bites. This is the shark's only method of getting a feel for things. These bites are no different than when a dog mouths something in order to get a feel for what that thing is. The biggest difference is that sharks have rows and rows of razor sharp teeth. The problem with calling these encounters &quot;attacks&quot; is that if a shark was attacking a person, that person would be dead. \n\n        The image of sharks as human killing machines is wrong.  Sharks may not be the gentlest creatures in the sea; they are after all one of the greatest predators in the oceans and arguably on of the greatest predators the world has ever seen but they are not indiscriminate in their killing. They use a natural process to help them select the prey that will give them the biggest caloric gain for the effort they have to put forth. They are smart hunters. They would rather spend their time hunting easy to kill, fat animals then something that is easy to kill and mostly muscle.\n\n        Shark &quot;attacks&quot; against humans are usually the result of mistaken identity. Surfers, the most commonly &quot;attacked&quot; human, look a lot like a seal from the bottom. A shark will come up from below in its normal attack pattern and bite the surfer. Typically, it immediately releases the surfer, shocked that it is not a seal and swims away.  Why would a predator eat an athletic human that has very little fat content compared to a seal that is covered in blubber? The energy that a shark would exert to kill and eat a human would make the caloric gain worthless. That same effort could be spent hunting and killing a creature that would actually have a benefit to the shark.\n\n        Another thing to consider is the actual chance that something will happen. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, from 1954 to 1994 in the United States, coastal areas have seen 6,470 lightning strikes of which 1,618 have been fatal. Compare this to shark attacks during this same period 412 attacks with 17 being fatal (&quot;A Comparison&quot;).  These &quot;attacks&quot; happen less often than a person getting struck by lightning.  This means if someone is going to worry about going somewhere, it would make more sense to worry about going outside and not worry about getting into the ocean. Keep in mind that if a person gets struck by lightning, that person will most likely experience some brain damage as well as a physical injury, possibly death. Shark attacks rarely end in death and if basic first aid is administered, it should prevent death by shark bite. \n\n        The movie Jaws scares the bejeezus out of a lot of people. The idea that there is something on this planet that could potentially kill a person so quickly and easily is a very common fear. Unfortunately, there are a large number of falsities in this image of sharks. For starters, the largest sharks are always females, yet the monster shark in the movie was a male. Also the sheer size of the Jaws shark was off the charts. Sharks, especially white sharks, can get quite large but the size of the one in the movie is impossible even for such an amazing fish to achieve. The part of Jaws that is the biggest myth is that a shark would hunt a person.  Sharks, like most predators, are lazy and want the big payoff at the end of a kill. These discriminating killers are being wiped out by one of the most indiscriminate killers on earth: human beings.\n\n        One of the ways that sharks are caught before being divested of their fins is through a process called long-line fishing. This is the process of laying out up to 20 miles of line with baited hooks behind a boat and dragging it through the ocean catching anything and everything.  Since sharks are such an efficient creature, they have very little decent meat compared to a tuna fish. When sharks are brought onto a boat they have their dorsal, pectoral and tail fins cut off and are tossed right back into the water. Sharks, unlike most fish, have to keep moving in order for water to move across their gills to produce oxygen. Without their fins they are unable to swim and they drown, much the same way a human being would drown if their arms and legs were tied before tossing them into the ocean. \n\n        Long lining would be just like someone hooking 40 miles of spiked cable to the back of his Hummer, driving through Yellowstone National Park and catching any animal it came into contact with. While going through the catch he would take any wolf or mountain lion, cut off its legs and then drop it back off into the forest, leaving it to bleed to death in its natural habitat. \n\n        This type of fishing is targeting tuna fish and other large species of fish that are the prey of sharks. What typically happens is that a shark will see the tuna floating aimlessly in the water above it. The shark will sneak up from below and bite the tuna getting itself stuck on the hook. All sharks caught by long lines are considered by-catch, which means they are the unwanted by product of an environmentally destructive fishing practice. \n\n        Another method of fishing that is detrimental to shark populations is drift nets. Drift nets are huge nets that are left for the day or week to drift in the ocean catching whatever they can. When they are picked up and opened on the deck, the fishermen go through and divide the catch up. Any sharks that are found are immediately relieved of their fins and tossed back into the water. \n\n        The process in which the fins are removed is possibly the most objectionable part of the whole process. Imagine a cow being caught, dragged to the ground and slaughtered while they mooed loudly. After all the meat was removed, the cows would be left to bleed to death on the very grass the cow grazed upon. As disgusting and immoral as this sounds, the de-finning of sharks happens in a very similar manner. What is worse for sharks is that they are not even a planned catch. They just happened to pop up on one of the hooks or in the  nets. Rather then let them go, the fishermen remove the only part of value and toss the rest into the ocean to die. \n\n        Another problem with long lining and drift net fishing is that they also lead to the overfishing of certain prey species leading the predators to seek different prey in larger numbers. It was discovered in the arctic that seals numbers were declining even though there was a ban on seal hunting. What was happening was that as more and more of the fish that were common prey of the larger predators were caught, the predators were forced to eat more and more seals. The overconsumption of these prey species can cause the same imbalance withing the smaller predator prey relationship that seals have with smaller fish and plants. \n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Continued next Monday, in the mean time please check out this <a href=\"http://termitedidge.blogspot.com/\">website</a>__.

I started learning to unicycle when when I was seventeen. I received a <a href=\"http://store.semcycle.com/product_info.php?products_id=6\">Semcycle 24&quot; Deluxe</a> for Christmas that year. Immeadiatly after receiving the unicycle I started to learn. Or should I say I tried to learn.</p>\n<p>During the time I was learning <a href=\"http://www.in5anity.org/\">Jon</a> was living with us, trying to graduate from High School and he was a great help to my learning. Without Jon I may not have learned as quick and it is possible that I would have given up before actually learning to ride. Since I had a partner to learn with I had someone pushing me to do better and learn faster.</p>\n<p>Since I started learning in January it was cold outside. Probably not as cold as it would have been if I lived further north but this was before global warming. Cold weather is not very conducive to learning to unicycle. Something about falling on cold concrete seems to be less fun then falling on warm or hot concrete. So instead of venturing out into the wild blue I started learning in the long hallway at my parents house. This was going great until I made a few scratches in the wall. After that I was banished to the basement.</p>\n<p>At the time our basement was wide open, no TV, no couches, just a pool table at one end and a bundle of book cases. This was great. I could start at the door and ride all the way to the pool table. Well I actually couldn&rsquo;t yet but that was the goal. I would get on the unicycle with a death grip on the door and try to make it as far as possible. This worked out great until disaster struck.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really that big of deal, when you are first learning to unicycle you have no idea where the unicycle is going to end up and where you are going to end up. I had just started to lean forward to attempt to ride across the family room when the unicycle slipped out from under me and slammed into the wall. Hard. The unicycle&rsquo;s wheel left a unicycle tire size hole in the wall. For those of you that don&rsquo;t know unicycle tires are basically the same as bicycle tires but it just sounds cool to call them unicycle tires.</p>\n<p>Needless to say my dad was none to happy about this hole. This simple event led to me, Jon and the unicycle being banished to the out of doors, cold weather or no, for the rest of the training period. Undeterred Jon and I took are training to the streets. Using the side of Bessie the Bug-o-love we started training in earnest.</p>\n<p>For the next few months Jon and I spent hours a day taking turns learning to ride. One of us would take the unicycle, mount it using the side of the bug and then lean forward peddling furiously. The other one would yell encouragement and get ready for their turn. We would talk about what worked and what didn&rsquo;t and just keep trying.</p>\n<p>Eventually I was able to make it around the block, then it was a mile and then it was miles. I even got to where I was able to ride around town like I would do with my bike. Since I first learned unicycling I have been trying to learn tricks on it.

I have included a handy <a href=\"/shark-references/\">reference page </a>__so you can see where I pulled my information. _</p>\n<p>Sharks. The word alone evokes powerful images: a fin slicing through dark water, a swimmer being suddenly pulled down from below, crimson stains spreading across the blue sea. Why is this? Is it because sharks are hungry human-killing machines? Or has their image been defined by media seeking to shock and terrify viewers? Ever since the classic film Jaws integrated these real animals into the template of the &ldquo;monster movie&rdquo;, the image of the shark as a  murderous juggernaut has become iconic. Stripping away the horror-movie hype, however, reveals a fascinating and surprisingly vulnerable sea creature. It may be difficult to associate the word &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; with sharks, as this side of them is rarely seen or talked about.

It is worth noting that there has also been a sharp decline in the overall weights of marine predators. Blue sharks caught in the past five years are up to thirty kilograms lighter than ones caught 50 years earlier (Di Menna 1).

I have included a handy [reference page ][1]__so you can see where I pulled my information. _\n\n   [1]: /shark-references/\n\nSharks. The word alone evokes powerful images: a fin slicing through dark water, a swimmer being suddenly pulled down from below, crimson stains spreading across the blue sea. Why is this? Is it because sharks are hungry human-killing machines? Or has their image been defined by media seeking to shock and terrify viewers? Ever since the classic film Jaws integrated these real animals into the template of the \"monster movie\", the image of the shark as a  murderous juggernaut has become iconic. Stripping away the horror-movie hype, however, reveals a fascinating and surprisingly vulnerable sea creature. It may be difficult to associate the word \"vulnerable\" with sharks, as this side of them is rarely seen or talked about.

I happen to have a lot of fabrics lying around my house and I choose a 100% cotton fat quarter that wasn&rsquo;t being used for anything else. I used my chalk to draw out the shape i wanted the creature to be.  I choose a bear since it is a fairly simple shape though sewing on the curves can be a little tricky. Another thing to keep in mind when drawing your creature on the fabric is that you need to draw it at least 1/2&quot; bigger then you want the finished product to be, this allows for the seam as well as allowing you a little wiggle room.

Since you need to have two pieces to sew together, make sure are cutting two pieces at the same time. That way they are the same size and any errors on one are the same on the other.

This is done with the fabric right side together. Right side together means that the pretty sides of the fabric are facing one another. Doing this allows the pretty side to face out when you turn it right side out. If you can&rsquo;t tell which side of the fabric is the right side because both sides look the same then it dosen&rsquo;t matter which on is the right side, just pin them together and you are ready for step 4.</li>\n<li>As you can see from the picture above I was very careful to sew exactly a 1/4&quot; <a href=\"/media/2009/02/step3-2.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/2009/02/step3-2-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"step3-2\"></a>seam. This will make this bear very full bodied and great to hug. If this is your first time using a sewing machine, be carful!, I don&rsquo;t want any injuries because of this blog. Remember to go slow and steady, make sure you backstitch and don&rsquo;t sew all the way around. You need to leave an opening to stuff the bear.

				"title": "Dirty Water Diving",
				"content_html": "<p>One of my brothers co-workers recently contacted me about doing some SCUBA diving this summer. I am excited as well as a little nervous. It is always nerve wracking to go diving with a new buddy, you don&rsquo;t know there experience level other then what it says on their certification card.</p>\n<p>I am fairly confident in my diving ability due to the amount of time that I have spent studying diving and the hours I have spent underwater. Since SCUBA diving involves life support systems everyone needs to be on top of their game.</p>\n<p>Most students start out SCUBA diving by trying it out either in a pool or on a tropical vacation. This is usually a good first experience with diving but it doesn&rsquo;t really delve into half of the dangerous situations that can happen underwater.</p>\n<p>In my experience most recreational SCUBA instructors fail to place the proper feeling of danger into diving. I can understand this since they are instructors to make money but I fear for a lot of divers that are not adequately trained. Diving is one of those activities that can go wrong in a heart beat.</p>\n<p>One of the things that most dive schools do teach and teach well is dive planning. Dive planning is the part of every dive that can decide if you live or die. The planning itself is pretty straight forward: we are going to go to this depth, stay for this length of time and then surface.</p>\n<p>The problem lies in when you deviate from the plan. Most diving injuries that I have heard about come from staying to long at a given depth. This leads to Decompression Sickness, which is bad news. DCS is not necessarily deadly, mostly it damages tissue and breaks bones. Getting DCS is a great way to get a trip into a decompression chamber, which is an awesome experience if you are not in incredible amounts of pain.</p>\n<p>These deviations tend to occur when the person in charge of bottom time loses track of how much time they have spent underwater. The first time this happens you will panic especially if you are below forty feet. Most recreational divers rarely venture below the forty foot mark, this is especially true in Colorado where most of the diving takes place in lakes throughout the state.</p>\n<p>Another factor that can make this lake diving difficult is that viability is pretty much crap. A foot is average with some of it creeping closer to mere inches. This makes keeping track of your buddy even trickier since you can lose your buddy if you glace away for a second.</p>\n<p>I realize that I make it sound as if SCUBA diving is too dangerous to be undertaken by ordinary people. Nothing could be further from the truth. I just feel that people should be aware of what they are getting into and that it isn&rsquo;t a 100% safe sport. Few people die of SCUBA diving accidents every year and almost everyone can be traced to a lack of planning and deviating from the dive plan.</p>\n<p>I think that everyone should experience SCUBA diving at some point in their life.

				"content_text": "\nOne of my brothers co-workers recently contacted me about doing some SCUBA diving this summer. I am excited as well as a little nervous. It is always nerve wracking to go diving with a new buddy, you don't know there experience level other then what it says on their certification card.\n\nI am fairly confident in my diving ability due to the amount of time that I have spent studying diving and the hours I have spent underwater. Since SCUBA diving involves life support systems everyone needs to be on top of their game.\n\nMost students start out SCUBA diving by trying it out either in a pool or on a tropical vacation. This is usually a good first experience with diving but it doesn't really delve into half of the dangerous situations that can happen underwater.\n\nIn my experience most recreational SCUBA instructors fail to place the proper feeling of danger into diving. I can understand this since they are instructors to make money but I fear for a lot of divers that are not adequately trained. Diving is one of those activities that can go wrong in a heart beat.\n\nOne of the things that most dive schools do teach and teach well is dive planning. Dive planning is the part of every dive that can decide if you live or die. The planning itself is pretty straight forward: we are going to go to this depth, stay for this length of time and then surface.\n\nThe problem lies in when you deviate from the plan. Most diving injuries that I have heard about come from staying to long at a given depth. This leads to Decompression Sickness, which is bad news. DCS is not necessarily deadly, mostly it damages tissue and breaks bones. Getting DCS is a great way to get a trip into a decompression chamber, which is an awesome experience if you are not in incredible amounts of pain.\n\nThese deviations tend to occur when the person in charge of bottom time loses track of how much time they have spent underwater. The first time this happens you will panic especially if you are below forty feet. Most recreational divers rarely venture below the forty foot mark, this is especially true in Colorado where most of the diving takes place in lakes throughout the state.\n\nAnother factor that can make this lake diving difficult is that viability is pretty much crap. A foot is average with some of it creeping closer to mere inches. This makes keeping track of your buddy even trickier since you can lose your buddy if you glace away for a second.\n\nI realize that I make it sound as if SCUBA diving is too dangerous to be undertaken by ordinary people. Nothing could be further from the truth. I just feel that people should be aware of what they are getting into and that it isn't a 100% safe sport. Few people die of SCUBA diving accidents every year and almost everyone can be traced to a lack of planning and deviating from the dive plan.\n\nI think that everyone should experience SCUBA diving at some point in their life. Floating perfectly neutral in water is one of the most amazing experiences in the world. I would love to be able to explain exactly what the feeling is but until you experience it for yourself you will never understand. For all the potential dangers that you may experience, if you are smart and follow the rules you will make it out of the water safe and sound every time.\n\n**Happy Birthday Liz!!**\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Recently the gaming group finished up the first arc in Jon&rsquo;s wonderful mutants and masterminds campaign. I thought that I would take the break in the action as a time to talk about my favorite gaming system. I realize I made a video of this same type of thing but as I have yet to become a true fan of video blogging I figured I would write up a review as well. This review is coming after a longer time playing the game and with a slight break between the gaming and the written review. This is what has stuck with me in the three weeks since we stopped playing.</p>\n<p>Online Dungeons and Dragons (DnD), the Mutants and Masterminds (MnM) rule system is very organic. There are a lot of rules to learn but the game encourages breaking those rules with the permission of the game master. It even goes so far as to mention that the game master is responsible for the enjoyment of the players and that rules should be bent and broken to provide the best experience. This encourages a level of improvisation that other games lack.</p>\n<p>This kind of fluid rule system is needed in a system where you can quite literally play any character you can imagine. Our group had a Batman/Rorschach type character, a fallen angel and a man who turns into a razor demon. The Skull was our Batman, always planning and kicking some henchmen butt. On top of that he was able to hold his own in single combat with a lot of the super villians, Elimesial was the fallen angel. He had wings, a flaming sword and a foul mouth. He was also trying to work his way back into heaven. Finally we had Razor, a normal everyday 25 year old who could transform into a thirteen foot tall razor demon complete with a devil like tail. Three more unlikely heros have never worked together.</p>\n<p>Character creation is my favorite part of any tabletop game. Ask the boys and they will tell you that I make five to ten characters to there one. This usually means that my characters lack elaborate back stories but is also means that I get a lot of experience using the creation system. MnM uses a points system with a separate power level limiting how powerful your character can be. These points, known as power points, are used to purchase everything from powers to saving throws. What makes this into such a powerful system is that you can literally create any type of character you can imagine.</p>\n<p>The creators of the system have taken the time to create a lot of general powers which you can modify with descriptions, drawbacks, feats and the like. This means that you can select flight and then with you description decide if the hero is able to fly like Superman, uses a jet pack like the Rocketeer, has wings like a bird or any other method of flying you can come up with. Trust me when I say that with this system you can create any type of hero you can imagine.</p>\n<p>You want a hero that is made of Guinea Pigs and shoots them at his foes? Easy, you just select the Alternate Form power then spend your points within that to get Blast: Guinea Pigs. Then take the time to think about what other things you could do with a body made of Guinea Pigs. Adjust other powers to fit. If, instead, you decide to go with the hero that poops unicorns that then fight crime all you have to do is select the Summon Minions power and add Poop Unicorns as a descriptor.</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the first character you create will be the most difficult. I would suggest creating at least three characters before working on the hero that you are going to want to play. This should help you get the feel for things and prevent you from wasting a lot of points on unnecessary powers.</p>\n<p>Gameplaywise MnM, like most Tabletop RPGs, requires a game master that can engage his players. This is even more important in MnMs since the rules are so fluid, with characters potentially being able to speak to objects, throw battleships and control minds.</p>\n<p>Overall I would say that MnM is my favorite system. It allows you to truly create characters from the ground up. Instead of having to create a character that falls within a preset class you can create you own class. This can make balancing a party a little bit tricky but also creates a lot of great role playing.</p>\n",

Our group had a Batman/Rorschach type character, a fallen angel and a man who turns into a razor demon. The Skull was our Batman, always planning and kicking some henchmen butt. On top of that he was able to hold his own in single combat with a lot of the super villians, Elimesial was the fallen angel. He had wings, a flaming sword and a foul mouth. He was also trying to work his way back into heaven. Finally we had Razor, a normal everyday 25 year old who could transform into a thirteen foot tall razor demon complete with a devil like tail. Three more unlikely heros have never worked together.\n\nCharacter creation is my favorite part of any tabletop game. Ask the boys and they will tell you that I make five to ten characters to there one. This usually means that my characters lack elaborate back stories but is also means that I get a lot of experience using the creation system. MnM uses a points system with a separate power level limiting how powerful your character can be. These points, known as power points, are used to purchase everything from powers to saving throws. What makes this into such a powerful system is that you can literally create any type of character you can imagine.\n\nThe creators of the system have taken the time to create a lot of general powers which you can modify with descriptions, drawbacks, feats and the like. This means that you can select flight and then with you description decide if the hero is able to fly like Superman, uses a jet pack like the Rocketeer, has wings like a bird or any other method of flying you can come up with. Trust me when I say that with this system you can create any type of hero you can imagine.\n\nYou want a hero that is made of Guinea Pigs and shoots them at his foes? Easy, you just select the Alternate Form power then spend your points within that to get Blast: Guinea Pigs. Then take the time to think about what other things you could do with a body made of Guinea Pigs. Adjust other powers to fit. If, instead, you decide to go with the hero that poops unicorns that then fight crime all you have to do is select the Summon Minions power and add Poop Unicorns as a descriptor.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the first character you create will be the most difficult. I would suggest creating at least three characters before working on the hero that you are going to want to play. This should help you get the feel for things and prevent you from wasting a lot of points on unnecessary powers.\n\nGameplaywise MnM, like most Tabletop RPGs, requires a game master that can engage his players. This is even more important in MnMs since the rules are so fluid, with characters potentially being able to speak to objects, throw battleships and control minds.\n\nOverall I would say that MnM is my favorite system. It allows you to truly create characters from the ground up. Instead of having to create a character that falls within a preset class you can create you own class. This can make balancing a party a little bit tricky but also creates a lot of great role playing.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I don&rsquo;t really know if these will actually be musings, mostly because I am not entirely certain that I know what a musing is. Fable II is awesome. Ridiculously so. I am enjoying playing this game more then any other game this year and possibly last year. This of course comes with a condition. I am comparing this only to other sandbox or role-playing games.</p>\n<p>In the past couple years I have played Oblivion, Mass Effect, Grand Theft Auto Four and Saints Row. I have enjoyed each in its own way but have yet to find one that combines everything that I love from those games into one cohesive package. Fable II comes pretty close to doing this. It has a minor RPG element allowing you to level and increase your stats which is like Oblivion. Like GTA4 and Saints Row you are allowed to do whatever you want, killing whoever and whatever. This leads us to the Mass Effect good vs bad system. In Fable II you are able to become a demonic psychopath with very little work. Unfortunately like most games that have a good/evil track this has very little effect on the actual game play. NPCs act no different towards you when you are evil then they do when you are a saint. I guess technically they are more likely to run from you when you are evil and charge you more for equipment and the like, but this has little effect on you since you can kill people and take their stuff/gold/anything you want.</p>\n<p>One of the most enjoyable parts of the game has been the real estate system. You can but pretty much every building in the game. Sure it costs a lot of money to buy the really nice buildings but you are able to adjust prices on stalls that you own as well as charge rents for the houses you buy which makes buying more property really easy. Another thing that the designers did right on this game is that you make money in game even when you are not playing. This means, since I own most of the world, I make about 21000 gold every five minutes in game. This number is reduced out of game until it is 1% of that every five minutes out of game. This is about 210 gold every five minutes or 60000 gold every day spent not playing the game.</p>\n<p>This has led to the other problem with the game. I have money to burn, I can buy everything in the game without batting an eye. Like most RPGs you eventually reach the point in which you cannot be killed. In fact in this game I am un killable. I cannot be knocked out, hurt or anything. This takes a little bit of the worry out of the game. I am not worried for my character&rsquo;s safety so I am not very dedicated to protecting him during combat, I just stand toe to toe with no strategy.</p>\n<p>Spoiler: the ending is lame. I was so disappointed that I haven&rsquo;t played any of the after finishing the main quest missions at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fallout-3\">FALLOUT 3</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Jon I have just started playing Fallout 3. It takes every other RPG I have played and makes it cry. Not only is it post-apocalyptic in all it&rsquo;s glory, but the story is engaging, it has great creatures and it has a fancy combat system.</p>\n<p>There is nothing I like better then wondering around a wasteland, getting attacked by giant mole-rats and actually being afraid for my character&rsquo;s life. It kicks some major butt. I don&rsquo;t have much more to say right now since I just started but suffice to say it is my current favorite game.</p>\n<p>I am not going to speak to the middle of the game because there is so much to it that you can&rsquo;t even begin to sum it up into a few measly sentences.

Last time we met I spoke about my love/hate problem with IKEA. Well we got a call from the delivery service not long after I posted last and needless to say are bed arrived and is put together and is awesome. The combination of new bed, feather top for our bed, Jesus blanket and being tired after work/school mean that I have been sleeping really good.</p>\n<p>I have been getting my owned by Spanish class. This is to the point that I am scared of not passing. Well I was, then I realized that it is Spanish, that it is hard. I am an English speaker. I stand little chance against the language that is Spanish. Part of the frustration is that I am working my butt off and not doing anywhere as well as I think I should be. I am much more used to doing what I do in my English class. I realize that it is funny that I am in English 123 and Spanish 112 in the same semester. In English class I go to class, have discussions with the teacher and write papers. I don&rsquo;t try very hard, mostly because I am lazy, but I get my work done on time and in a way that is acceptable to my teacher.</p>\n<p>In Spanish I study verbs, tenses, vocabulary and tenses. Yeah I study them twice because tenses are hard. Unlike English where I rock tenses, able to switch between them with ease, in Spanish I have a hard time keeping them straight. On advantage to Spanish vs English is that word order tends to be a lot more loose. As along as the words are all in a sentence people get what you are saying. This makes it great for learning to speak the language but on the flip side it makes it harder to learn how to understand. You aren&rsquo;t necessarily going to be able to recognize the sentence structure, you have to actually know all of the words.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I find the language to be very interesting and I am excited to learn more and more. Some day I will be fluent and then I will write secrets to my Spanish speaking readers. Take that gringos.</p>\n<p>In the rest of my classes I am enjoying them. Art history is great because it is pictures. Being a fairly visual learner I am a big fan of pictures. I also like all of the stories that surround different time periods, Egypt I am looking at you, as well as the fact that you can see the progression of art through the ages. English, as I mentioned before, is great. I am able to write my essays pretty quickly, sure researching can suck a little but since I am writing about sharks I am very interested in my topic.</p>\n<p>I have also noticed an increase in the number of people that I know that have started to blog. A few of them are super duper funny. A couple of them are brand new and a few of them are just another blog. The first one is my favorite. It is the blog of my friend <a href=\"http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&amp;friendID=306504962\">Jon</a>. He writes entries that amuse me to know end. I would suggest reading his from the beginning since his blog is relatively new and it would be easy to get through. Peter&rsquo;s is the next blog of amusidness he writes things that we all think. I really enjoyed his post on triangle food. Unfortunately myspace hates my browser when I try to go to his blog on myspace so I am just posting his myspace <a href=\"http://www.elburrovolador.com\">Matt</a>&rsquo;s blog. My brother in-law has finally entered into the world of blogs. I help him get it set up through word press and it can be found here. His is less then four days old and will probably be a much more personal blog to himself. There you have it all of the new blogs.</p>\n<p>Sarah and I got Guitar Hero World Tour as a late anniversary present from my parents. It is awesome. We got the whole band package including drums, guitar and microphone. We where pretty excited about the drums and guitar, but the singing was a definite Ã¢a‚¬Å&quot;ehÃ¢a‚¬Â, nobody wants to sing. Well we finally tried it. The singing isn&rsquo;t so bad if you know the song, it is just a matter of controlling the pitch of your voice, you don&rsquo;t even really have to sing or say the correct words for that matter. The interface is pretty easy to use and seems to work pretty well. The drums and guitar are as fun as we expected, we have both received blisters from playing and it basically kicks ass.</p>\n<p>As you might have noticed I have started turning my doodles into drawings of sorts. I have started to submit more and more things to the critiques section of threadless. I am really enjoying this whole process I just wish that the people who comment on critiques where more helpful then just saying Ã¢a‚¬Å&quot;This is dumb.Ã¢a‚¬Â This happens more often the I care to see and I always hope that people will leave some form of constructive criticism. Please take a look at my <a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/profile/174696/reallyreallyawesomeguy/critiques\">critiques</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is a quick rundown on my designs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/30999/Our_Lady_Bunnylupe\">Our Lady of Bunnylupe</a> is a design that I thought of while I was in Spanish class. We where talking about the patron saints of certain parts of Mexico and Latin America. There is of course Our Lady Guadalupe and I wondered what Rabbits in that part of the world worshiped. Bunnylupe of course.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/30802/First_One_is_Free\">First Ones Free</a> is my current favorite. I love the look of the carrot giving his babies to the rabbit. I think that this design needs something more, probably some sort of shading like the others have suggested. This was one of the first designs that I drew completely on the computer. It started out with a rabbit being in love with a frog, but frogs are really hard to draw, so I changed it to a carrot. It went downhill from there. I added the scared baby carrots and viola.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/30888/What_are_you_looking_at\">What Are You Looking At?</a> Is one that I don&rsquo;t know can be printed how I would like. I imagine being a roller print where it is just rolled onto a shirt and looking awesome. I started this one in a meeting, getting a group of ducks together. I then started drawing more and more until the whole shirt was covered.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/31147/Can_you_spare_a_nut\">Can You Spare a Nut?</a> The elephant needs knees. I love the look on this ones face. He looks like he really wants a peanut. Do you have one. I also started to experiment a little more with having a background that isn&rsquo;t just a solid color.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/30003/T_P_Squeeze\">T.P. Squeeze</a> is awesome. This is a design that came quickly. Based on nothing and hilarious I need to get back to work on this one. I need to make it a little more detailed and possibly add some clouds that he is flying through.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/29058/Head_Heart\">Head/Heart</a> a pattern that I had a lot of fun drawing. Nothing is cooler then bald heads with aviator glasses in the shape of a heart. Am I right or am I right? No I just need to perfect the over all look and get it submitted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/23791/Don_t_Judge_the_Bunny\">Don&rsquo;t Judge a Bunny</a> is my tribute to Fantasy Island and Dungeons and Dragons. One of the first designs I really worked hard on. I really like this design though I don&rsquo;t know if enough people will get the idea to get it printed. I guess all I can do is try.</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.threadless.com/critique/23867/Photobot_5000\">Photobot 5000</a> was a possible submission for one of the contests on threadless that I didn&rsquo;t get done in time. I still want to finish this one and get it sent in to see how it fairs. I just need some time to finish it.</p>\n<p>Well I guess that is probably enough for now,see you next time I decide to update. If you want to know when I submit more designs let me know and I will add you to the emails I am going to start sending out.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Sometimes blogging is hard.

Get a nice hard surface to work on. If you have no good areas to work in your house then go to the local library and use their study rooms.</li>\n<li>Get a Good Night Sleep- Go to bed early and set your alarm. Make sure that you give yourself enough time to sleep and that you wake up refreshed. Getting to much sleep is as bad as not getting enough.</li>\n<li>Get Advised- As a returning or continuing education student things have changed from when you first went to school. If you have never been to school before, advisors can really help you.</li>\n<li>Get Advised- This is on here twice because you should get advised at your school and any school you are planning on attending. The advice you get about course you should take from the school you want to transfer to is more important then what you current school advisor says.</li>\n<li>Get Involved- Don&rsquo;t be a wall flower, go to events.

There is a chance that that person is good at something that you may be poor at, you can then ask them to help.</li>\n<li>Relax- Plan relaxing into your day. If there is something that you like to do, plan breaks in your studies that allow you to do this.

				"content_html": "<p>Well it is over. The first day of school has come and gone. My brain is dead, or at least it was dead last night. I was a super good kid and got all of my homework done right after class. So much reading. Here is a quick breakdown of what went down yesterday.</p>\n<p>My day started at the new early time that was just invented, 5:10am. Prior to Sarah starting teaching this was an unheard of time to get up unless you where taking someone to the airport. I spent the first part of the morning helping Sarah get ready for work: packing lunch, carrying stuff to her car, etc. After she had left I got ready to go and realized that it was 6:15am and I didn&rsquo;t have class until 9ish. So I did what any good kid would do, I started to read my first reading assignment in all of my books.</p>\n<p>How, you may be asking, do I know the reading assignments? About a month prior to the semester starting I emailed my teachers and asked for a copy of their syllabus so that I could better plan my semester. All of them where very helpful and sent them to me right away. Because of this I have been able to plan out my schedule about two weeks in advance.</p>\n<p>I was only able to get half of my reading done before I needed to head off to class. My first class is Art History I. This was a class that takes care of a humanity credit and it is also something that Sarah knows a lot about, so if I need help I can get it. The best part of this first day of class was that the teacher was someone that I went to high school with. I always figure that it can&rsquo;t hurt you to know the teacher. This class was typical first day stuff. We went of the syllabus, she told us about herself, we went around the room and introduced ourselves and we got out early. Once out of class I headed straight for the common area for a grilled cheese sandwich. It was quite good for a breakfast sandwich. Note to self: Eat before class.</p>\n<p>After enjoying my little snack I headed to my English Composition II class. This is the class that I fear will suck out all of my time. This is the 12-15 page research paper class. It has been a long time since I have had to write anything and I have never had to write more then five pages for a single paper. Amazingly that isn&rsquo;t what makes me nervous. I am afraid of researching. I am relatively good at finding sources for Sarah when she needed some for papers she was writing, but I have no experience analyzing the info and writing it in an effective way.</p>\n<p>Luckily most of the kids in my class seem to be in the same boat. We have to come up with ten topics by Thursday as well as write a paragraph or more about ourselves. So far I have come up with three topics, one that seems to be relatively strong and the rest seem to be so-so. Hopefully I can come up with at least one more good topic before generating a bunch of crap filler topics. The part of the topic assignment that is making it tricky is that the paper has to be argumentative. I guess I could argue that Killer Whales are more dangerous then Great White Sharks. All right, make that two good and two throw away topics.</p>\n<p>After my classes where done I went to a computer lab to check emails, do some typing and reading. I was doing great until my iPod ran out of power and died. This meant that I had no music to read by and had to listen to the stupid chatter of the people sitting directly in front of me. It was about that time that I decided to change locations. I walked across campus, it was so beautiful out, to the library. The lack of noise in the library and the comfortable couches made it my new favorite study area. I was able to finish my English reading and then I decided to head home.</p>\n<p>Once I arrived home I made up a late lunch and watched a few batman cartoons. After I had finished my lunch and root beer I decided to read part of my Art History reading and then watch a cartoon, I repeated this until my reading was finished.

				"content_html": "<p>I have started back to school again. For those of you who donÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know I have tried school a bundle of times. I started out, like most kids, right after high school. I was going to go to Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO. For some reason I cannot remember at this time I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t end up going there. I think I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know what I wanted to do in college and so I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t want to move away from my friends and family. I really did know what I wanted to do; it just wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t a major at any college I could find. I wanted to be a clown.</p>\n<p>After cancelling on Fort Lewis I enrolled at the University of Northern Colorado as an elementary education major, since that is what everyone said I would be good at. Since my heart wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t in to what I was studying I failed spectacularly. I failed so well you might even say that I was a successful failure. I dropped out after a semester and a half completing all of about three classes.</p>\n<p>After that experience I thought that maybe I just wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t meant for the big school experience and would just go to Aims Community College, get my associates degree and then head back for a bachelorÃ¢a‚¬a„¢s degree. Once again I went through the whole: What do I want to do? Who do I want to be? I still didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know, well I knew that I wanted to be a clown but that still didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t fit into any given major. Since I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know what I wanted to be or what I wanted to do I failed again.</p>\n<p>I quit going to Aims, failing my third quarter classes with flying colors and feeling quite stupid. I was still living at home and it was killing me inside to have to go home and hear how good my brother was doing at college, how successful he was and all that gunk. I needed to get out of there. So I started the internet research.</p>\n<p>Of all the possibilities I researched, commercial dive school appealed to me the most. I have been a SCUBA diver since I was 15 or so and have always been fascinated with the underwater world. I applied to the College of Oceaneering and lo and behold I was accepted. I was excited, about school. It was confusing and awesome at the same time.</p>\n<p>It was about that time that I started this blog. Feel free to peruse the first year of entries to get an idea of what school was like as well as what went on in my life. A brief summary goes a little something like this. I kicked a lot of butt at school, became thankful I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t join the Navy out of high school, made some really good friends, got engaged, lived on my own in Compton, CA, learned a whole bunch about diving and then to top it all off I came back to ColoradoÃ¢a‚¬Â¦ where there are a lot of OceansÃ¢a‚¬Â¦ stupid geography.</p>\n<p>There I was hanging out in Colorado, living with my folks again and starting to become unhappy. It was about that time that I tricked my beautiful wife, then fiancÃƒÂ(C), into letting me move in with her. YouÃ¢a‚¬a„¢ll have to ask her how that happened, because I am still not sure how it worked. If her parents ask just tell them that I always slept on the couch. I became happier, working my job as a welding inspector and coming home to Sarah every night. Life was good-ish.</p>\n<p>I wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t exactly proud of myself or of very much I had accomplished in life. I still felt the need to go back to school and get that ever important degree. I wondered for about six or seven years looking for a chance or excuse to go back to school. It has finally happened.</p>\n<p>It all started last January when I took College Algebra, the bane of my previous college attempts. It is not that I donÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t like math it is just that math doesnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t like me. I understand math, it is just so boring. Well I am happy to say that in May of 2008 I successfully got a Ã¢a‚¬ËoeCÃ¢a‚¬a„¢ in College Algebra. I was on my way. Over that summer I took Ethnic Literature and Spanish 1. I passed them both, with an Ã¢a‚¬ËoeAÃ¢a‚¬a„¢ and a Ã¢a‚¬ËoeBÃ¢a‚¬a„¢. It was crazy.</p>\n<p>I felt, and still feel, good about myself. I am in danger of doing well in school for the first time in my academic life. I am studying, learning and having a really good time. I wouldnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t change what I did prior to coming back to school for anything, though I wish I would have finish all of that stuff quicker. I am running into some interesting situations at school.

				"content_text": "\nI have started back to school again. For those of you who donÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know I have tried school a bundle of times. I started out, like most kids, right after high school. I was going to go to Fort Lewis College in Durango, CO. For some reason I cannot remember at this time I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t end up going there. I think I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know what I wanted to do in college and so I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t want to move away from my friends and family. I really did know what I wanted to do; it just wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t a major at any college I could find. I wanted to be a clown.\n\nAfter cancelling on Fort Lewis I enrolled at the University of Northern Colorado as an elementary education major, since that is what everyone said I would be good at. Since my heart wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t in to what I was studying I failed spectacularly. I failed so well you might even say that I was a successful failure. I dropped out after a semester and a half completing all of about three classes.\n\nAfter that experience I thought that maybe I just wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t meant for the big school experience and would just go to Aims Community College, get my associates degree and then head back for a bachelorÃ¢a‚¬a„¢s degree. Once again I went through the whole: What do I want to do? Who do I want to be? I still didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know, well I knew that I wanted to be a clown but that still didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t fit into any given major. Since I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t know what I wanted to be or what I wanted to do I failed again.\n\nI quit going to Aims, failing my third quarter classes with flying colors and feeling quite stupid. I was still living at home and it was killing me inside to have to go home and hear how good my brother was doing at college, how successful he was and all that gunk. I needed to get out of there. So I started the internet research.\n\nOf all the possibilities I researched, commercial dive school appealed to me the most. I have been a SCUBA diver since I was 15 or so and have always been fascinated with the underwater world. I applied to the College of Oceaneering and lo and behold I was accepted. I was excited, about school. It was confusing and awesome at the same time.\n\nIt was about that time that I started this blog. Feel free to peruse the first year of entries to get an idea of what school was like as well as what went on in my life. A brief summary goes a little something like this. I kicked a lot of butt at school, became thankful I didnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t join the Navy out of high school, made some really good friends, got engaged, lived on my own in Compton, CA, learned a whole bunch about diving and then to top it all off I came back to ColoradoÃ¢a‚¬Â¦ where there are a lot of OceansÃ¢a‚¬Â¦ stupid geography.\n\nThere I was hanging out in Colorado, living with my folks again and starting to become unhappy. It was about that time that I tricked my beautiful wife, then fiancÃƒÂ(C), into letting me move in with her. YouÃ¢a‚¬a„¢ll have to ask her how that happened, because I am still not sure how it worked. If her parents ask just tell them that I always slept on the couch. I became happier, working my job as a welding inspector and coming home to Sarah every night. Life was good-ish.\n\nI wasnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t exactly proud of myself or of very much I had accomplished in life. I still felt the need to go back to school and get that ever important degree. I wondered for about six or seven years looking for a chance or excuse to go back to school. It has finally happened.\n\nIt all started last January when I took College Algebra, the bane of my previous college attempts. It is not that I donÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t like math it is just that math doesnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t like me. I understand math, it is just so boring. Well I am happy to say that in May of 2008 I successfully got a Ã¢a‚¬ËoeCÃ¢a‚¬a„¢ in College Algebra. I was on my way. Over that summer I took Ethnic Literature and Spanish 1. I passed them both, with an Ã¢a‚¬ËoeAÃ¢a‚¬a„¢ and a Ã¢a‚¬ËoeBÃ¢a‚¬a„¢. It was crazy.\n\nI felt, and still feel, good about myself. I am in danger of doing well in school for the first time in my academic life. I am studying, learning and having a really good time. I wouldnÃ¢a‚¬a„¢t change what I did prior to coming back to school for anything, though I wish I would have finish all of that stuff quicker. I am running into some interesting situations at school. I am not the oldest student in my classes; most of the older students are over forty and are changing careers by going back to school. The majority of the other students are eighteen years old. \n\nI am the Green Kangaroo. I am in the middle of these to age groups. I have a hard time identifying with the younger students due to the almost ten year gap in our ages, but I am young enough looking that they assume that I am their age. .  I have a harder time talking to the students who are older than me because I am perceived as being one of the young ones. On top of that I find most of the older students frustrating to work with because of their refusal to believe that I might know what I am talking about when it comes to in class work.\n\nI know that there has to be other students out there that are in a similar boat. These posts are for you. Also if you are over twenty four and under thirty two and thinking about going back to school; I hope that I can provide some insight into the world of college as an older but not ancient student. Well wish me luck, classes have started and I am ready to get started with my first full time semester at school in about five or six years.\n",

Most of the games have a starter set that allows you to jump right in and play. This means that You don&rsquo;t have to understand the deck building mechanics you just have to get the gist of the game rules and fumble along through a few games to get a feel for what you like. Then if you want you can start playing around with deck building. I for one enjoy the deck building portion of the game. I find a new hero and I want to build a deck around that hero.</p>\n<p>In most table top RPG&rsquo;s you spend a long long time reading and understanding the rules, creating characters, finding people to play with, putting on disguises so people won&rsquo;t recognize you and telling your wife that you are just going out with the boys to a strip club or bar. With CCG&rsquo;s the time commitment is much less, the characters already exist you just have to figure out your strategy and destroy your opponents. One other thing that the WoW CCG did was the raid decks. Now I haven&rsquo;t had time to play any of them yet, mostly because John and I need someone else to play with so that we can have a deck master and have all sorts of fun.

The game I am talking about is BANG! the cowboy western card fame. It is packaged as an innocent play with your family type game, but at its heart is a CCG just waiting to happen. The fun part about it is that it takes into account transportation and classes in a new way. For instance if you are the sheriff you want to kill the crooks and the vigilante, if you are the vigilante you want to kill the crooks and the sheriff, if you are the crook(s) you want to kill everyone else and if you are the sheriff&rsquo;s deputy you help the sheriff and take his job if he dies. The first time I played this it was in Chicago with Harper and Matiss, I think when I got my tattoo and I received it a while ago for a x-mas present.

I am specifically looking at Harper, but the rest of you should read it as well. One of the great parts of the book is the way the author builds the relationships between the characters. That and the Hell Hounds.</p>\n<p>Apparently there are some jokers online that are talking about the early realease of GTA IV.

I finally took a weekend off of the balloon making to have a relaxing weekend of not making balloons for tips. It was a definite hit in the ol' pocketbook but I think the relaxation was worth it. Plus Sarah and I finally where able to clean our house from top to bottom. But what made Friday night especially awesome is that John and I had ordered a box of booster decks for the World of Warcraft card game and it had arrived the previous night, for those of you paying attention that would be Thursday night. As you can see we ordered from the Dark Portal set and this is my half of the cards in the picture. John not only brought over a bundle of cards for me but he also bought me Taco Bell for dinner, which was delicious and tasty and only made my stomach a little sad. We quickly ate dinner and I opened my cards, what I found was a pretty good variety of standard cards and then in my last pack awesome happened. I finally have the cards necessary to make my priest hero competitive. I already have a hunter hero who pretty much owns the night, I have been trying to use my priest but he lacked abilities. I now have enough abilities to bring the noise as a priest against John&rsquo;s druid. We shall see.</p>\n<p>After I was done opening my cards John and I sat on the couch and watched Sweeney Todd. It was awesome. I cannot lie and say that I hate musicals, because deep down inside I know that I love them. And blood, I love bloody movies. This had both and to top it off cannibalism, what could be better. Johnny Depp was awesome, overall style of the movie was pure Tim Burton and, though I was worried at first, it wasn&rsquo;t as gory as I had read that it was. The worst part of the movie is the slide\\crash of the bodies when they are sent to the bake house. I don&rsquo;t think that this movie is for everybody. I think that if you where a nun who dislikes musicals then this movie might not be for you. In fact if you hate musicals you probably should avoid Sweeny Todd as it is a musical, a bloody good musical. Sorry about that.</p>\n<p>After enjoying Sweeny Todd John and I moved on to our new favorite pastime, killing terrorists. By killing terrorist I am, of course, referring to Rainbow 6 Vegas 2 on the Xbox 360. This is quite possibly the most fun co-op game that we have played. You have a team of four, two computers and two humans, and you spend most of the game rescuing hostages, disarming bombs and killing terrorists. It is quite a bit of fun, in a terrorist killing way. Another interesting part of the game is the addition of an almost RPG type element. As you progress through the game you gain XP which furthers your rank within the Rainbow organization. How do you gain XP? by killing terrorists of course. What do you get for leveling up? Armor, camouflage and other cosmetic equipment. On top of that they have added the ACES system which gives you credit depending on the method you employ to kill said terrorists. CQB: close quarters- killing when they are really close, Assault- killing them with explosives and Marksman- killing them from long range. Each time you reach a new ACES level it unlocks weapons. With the combination of the XP and ACES you unlock a plethora of weapons and armor making you the ultimate terrorist killing machine.</p>\n<p>Monday, which I had off from work (thanks Dad), was spent running around getting Sarah ready for another week at school. Which of course included a little shopping, a movie and the last bit of cleaning. My little bit of shopping was buying Endless Ocean, a SCUBA simulator of sorts. What is interesting about this game is that it is addicting like crack. I have only played it for about thirty minutes and already I have the itch to explore more. The entire point, if you can call it that, is to explore and find all of the different species of fish in the game. There is a huge fictional ocean to explore and it is quite pretty to explore, even though it is on the Wii. I spent most of my time in the Coral Forest, interacting with the fish that I saw twelve years ago in Cozumel, and then headed towards the deeper ocean areas in hopes of seeing a Whale Shark or Blue Whale. Hopefully they didn&rsquo;t include Orcas in the game since I don&rsquo;t really want to be eaten. I have also spent a lot of time playing with an African Penguin on the deck of my boat and trying to make friends with a dolphin under water. One thing that bothers me just a little is the way that the game choose to handle DCS and other diving maladies. It chose to ignore them. You are able to go up and down and stay under for ridiculous times without you depth affecting you air consumption. I understand that it is a game, but as someone who fully understands the <a href=\"http://www.dylanreed.org/2007/09/18/four-best-ways-to-die-while-scuba-diving/\">dangers</a> of SCUBA diving I think that they should be mentioned at some point early in the game. Something like &quot; Please don&rsquo;t try this without proper training&quot; . That will just prevent Nintendo from being sued when some kid takes his parent&rsquo;s SCUBA gear goes into the ocean or a lake, gets the bends, AGE or runs out of air and dies.</p>\n<p>This next week is going to be awesome, first off a week from today is the release of GTA IV. Which means that I will be busy for most evenings and weekends playing that game. At first I wasn&rsquo;t very excited about this game, I mean who needs another GTA really, but after seeing some of the videos and reading some impressions by people that have played the game, I need another GTA. I have played pretty much every game since the first one and I have enjoyed them all in their own way. The first one, which Harper brought home from college, was what really got me hooked on video games as a form of entertainment. I had always played games, but not with the enjoyment and intensity that I played the first GTA. As I moved on to the other top down GTA games I found them to be more frustrating then fun. The first one had the beauty of being the first and best of the games, it had a simplicity the led to a further enjoyment of the game. The last two top down games suffered from trying to be to complex and thus losing the fun that the first one had. Luckily they reinvented the genre and the game world when they released GTA III.</p>\n<p>Even if they borrowed a lot of story elements from Hollywood, the simple fact that you could do anything made this game the best game ever. GTA III was great because it allowed you to follow the story and then wonder off and kill police, sleep with hookers, be a taxi driver or vigilante and, best of all, just wonder around and take in the scenery. Following the same path as the original they released GTA Vice City, a Miami Vice storied expansion/sequel that added the most important element ever added to the GTA-style game. Motorcycles. With the addition of motorcycles the world opened up and what used to be a couple of minute of screwing around for every hour played became a couple of hours screwing around for every day played. There was nothing more fun then taking a crouch rocket to the airport and heading along the runway towards a conveniently placed ramp and fling across the city. It was awesome.</p>\n<p>When they released GTA San Andreas they had hit a wall. It was all about size. They gave up on creating a single city and instead created an entire state. They took every west coast hip hop stereotype and threw it into the game. Your crew consisted of a group of guys the could have been NWA a rising rap star reminded us all of 50-cent. There where crooked cops, turf wars and new to the game exercise. Yep exercise. There is nothing more fun then exercise. The world was huge and had a jet plan, helicopters, crazy off road vehicles and a jet pack. Even with all that it seemed forced. The area was to huge. There where vast expanses of open space and it took forever to travel somewhere you needed to go on the other side of the map. Of the three 3-d games San Andreas was the most disappointing. Because of this my hope for GTA IV where pretty slim.</p>\n<p>But then the first trailer came out. OMG, I mean, OMFG this game looked sweet, still I wasn&rsquo;t excited. Oh yeah it&rsquo;s the next generation of game systems, so of course it is going sweet. Then I started to read about the game engine, the physic engine and other engines as well. It started to sound cool. Plus Rockstar had included a cover system, finally fixed the aiming issues from the previous three games and added a fully functional online multiplayer. I am still worried for the game, I am afraid that they had gone too real, gotten away from the fun of the previous game and taken it to serious. I am still going to get the game and I will probably enjoy it. I just hope that the mindless fun is still there. Though if the fun has fled I am sure that it just ended up in Saints Row 2 for this fall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dylanreed.org//media/2008/04/million.gif\"><img src=\"http://www.dylanreed.org//media/2008/04/million-thumb.gif\" alt=\"million\"></a>Also a quick update of <a href=\"http://www.dylanreed.org/2008/04/03/oh-google-calendar-sync-your-such-a-tease/\">this</a>.

But like most hero's, his beginnings where super lame.\n\nHis mom, Francis, was a stern person, always making Chicky do his homework and not letting him go out for sports or play outside. This always made Chicky upset and he spent many hours in his room crying and wishing that he was special.\n\nSince he never met his father he wasn't prepared for his powers. He had left his house to go to school when it happened. He was walking along North East Hampton Avenue when he was struck by a lightning bolt of power.\n\nHe started to float off the sidewalk, not in control, not even flapping his wings. Laser beams started shooting out of his eyes and he felt different. Needless say he didn't go to school that day. He spent that day and the rest of the next floating around the atmosphere and wondering what in the heck was going on.\n\nThen he heard screaming, coming from... [[MORE]][2]\n\n   [2]: http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=10345835\n\n**The Snorker, Coffee Pig**\n\nEvil agent of El Torrence the bull, The Snorker was rescued from the pig farm at a young age by his mentor El Torrence, they formed an instant bond and El Torrence has raised Snorker to be his evil henchman.\n\nThe Snorker isn't normally a bad guy, his mom did her best to raise her son to not be evil. Unfortunately for her, and the rest of us, El Torrence was able to make him, if not evil at least he is a mediocre henchman.\n\nHe started off with petty crimes in the fields of armed robbery, diamond hiests and a casino job (failed casino job, he didn't have Snorkers 11, he only had 6). Then El Torrence sent him to kidnap some lady, who had a bird for a son, and it all went south...[[MORE]][3]\n\n   [3]: http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=10346593\n\n**El Torrence, Criminal Mastermind and Used Car Sales Bull**\n\nEl Torrence, or Torr for short, has been a used car sales person for about 25 years. He prided himself in selling people the best mode of transportation that fit there needs. He wasn't in it for the money, he was in it to help people.  \nYeah Right!  \nEl Torrence whole reason for getting into the car sales business is to try and increase the rate of global warming by selling more and more SUVs. His dealership specializes in gas guzzlers. He personally drives a H2 modified to use even more gas then the standard model.  \nOther areas that El Torrence's evil empire specializes in our racketeering and kidnapping. With his semi faithful henchman The Snorker and an ad in the paper to recruit more henchmen he hopes to one day take over the world or destroy it, whichever comes first.[[MORE]][4]\n\n   [4]: http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=10355248\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for all the creatures to come.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Last Saturday night I procured for myself a copy of Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Well I actually pre-ordered it on Saturday and picked it up on Sunday. It is a couple bundles worth of joy. There are a bunch of levels, a lot of characters to play with and it is very easy to pick up and play. My friend Jon and I played quite a few hours on Sunday and have continued to enjoy smash each other off of the levels.</p>\n<p>Here is a breakdown of my favorite characters thus far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Zelda: There is something about kicking ass as a princess that just feels right. I mean. Never mind. She is a great all around fighter and has the ability to teleport. I probably play as her 40% of the time. She rocks.</li>\n<li>Kirby: When I first saw that Kirby was one of the fighters I started looking for the Dyson as an unlockable fighter. Alas this is not so. However being able to suck in people and steal their powers is awesome. Plus he comes in so many fabulous colors.</li>\n<li>The Shock Rat: aka Pikachou is a pretty good pick up and play character. Mostly because he cheats. So much lightning and so much rage. He is an angry little <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/02/22\">bastard</a>. Probably because he is stuck in that <a href=\"http://www.vgcats.com/comics/?strip_id=1\">ball</a> all the time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another great part of Smash Bros is the fun I had at lunchtime with my cousins. We quickly got lunch and then went to do battle. Basically we battled for about 45 minutes and all in all it was a fun experience. I worked out the handicapping to so that I was not owning them as much as I was at the beginning of the game. The last game was an evenly matched fun fest that was fought on top of moving cars from the F-Zero series. It was nuts.</p>\n<p>The only downside so far is the online mode. Apparently Nintendo wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to the world of online gaming. They have a random person finder that dosen&rsquo;t work&hellip; ever. The friend mode is great, except I have no friends with wiis, so I have no wii-friends. I have to go to websites to find wii-friends and so far almost all of them have turned out to be total asses. At least on xbox live you can mute d-bags and continue to play them and laugh that they are losing. My first online match I was basically pummeled by two young kids on the same console that didn&rsquo;t even bother to fight each other they just ganged up on me. Some day the Internet slap will work and they will all pay.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>As you may or may not know a lot of really awesome video games are coming out in the next month. Not only is there going to be a lot of good games coming out but they all come out at about the same time. In fact they all come out in the first two weeks-ish of November.</p>\n<p>This just isn&rsquo;t fair, at between $40-$60 a pop how am I supposed to get to play all of the games I want. The problem with this generation of games is that developers have started making real in depth games that are hard to finish if you just rent them. Take Mass Effect for instance, this game is ridiculously in depth and allows for your choices to really reflect in the game play. Like I am going to finish that in a weekend.</p>\n<p>Here is the list of games that I want to get in November:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>![][1] This is an epic science fiction game. At the beginning you create a character (either male or female, but sadly human), deciding on your past as well as your general attitude. You then progress non-linearly though the game trying to save the universe. As you progress though the game your actions will reflect on peoples attitude towards you as well as how you will be perceived by other alien races. According to everything I have read on the game it should be insane. Enjoyable but insane.  Release Date:11.20.07</li>\n<li>[![][2]][3]This is another epic science fiction game, this time with everyone&rsquo;s favorite plumber in the lead. Apparently Bowser has entered the space race and stolen Princess Peach. During the kidnapping Bowser strands Mario in space. Since Mario is Italian he isn&rsquo;t affected by the fact the space is a vacuum and lives to fight another day. Actually I think that he gets help from cosmic knowledge fish (or something) that helps him survive. Then it is off to fight all of Bowser&rsquo;s Minions to rescue the princess. Release Date: 11.12.07</li>\n<li>![][4] Assassins creed is probably the game that I am most excited about. It is historical fiction at its greatest. They took a time period (the crusades), did a lot of research (most of the main characters killed during the game actually died around the same time in history) and made a beautiful game. You are this bad ass assassin who can climb walls and blend with crowds to escape. I think that they took all of the really fun parts of Splinter Cell and made it into an awesomely fun game of killing for the greater good. Release Date: 11.13.07</li>\n<li>![][5] The first Raving Rabbids game was awesome. It was silly and full of multi player mini game fun. The sequel should be equally fun and full of the humor and enjoyment of the first game. Apparently it is up to you, as Rayman, to fight off the Rabbid invasion. The Ubisoft team has painstakingly digitally photographed different real world locations and inserted the rabbid invaders. You as a plunger toting cowboy of sorts are charged with taking those rabbids out. Release Date: 11.16.07![][6]</li>\n<li>The next co-op game for Jon and I. After we beat Halo:3 we have been keep our eyes peeled for another fun co-op game. In this game you take on the role of an ex Army mercenary as you travel the world fighting in different conflicts just trying to make a buck. The game play centers around a buddy systems of the two mercenaries helping each other over and around obstacles as well as a Aggro system that allows one character to draw fire while the other sneaks around and kills the enemy. Release Date: 11.13.07</li>\n<li>![][7] Finally a SCUBA diving game. I know that me and probably five other people have always thought that a decent SCUBA game has been needed for a number of years. While the main focus of this game is exploration, I have yet to see any information on dangerous creature encounters or decompression issues. That aside I think that this game could be a lot of fun as well as allowing people who are afraid or unable to dive to experience the wonders of the underwater world. Release Date: 10.29.07</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog\">http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog</a> graphics 2/masseffectfinalboxboxart_160w.jpg\n[2]: <a href=\"http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/all/boxshots2/915692_68186.jpg\">http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/all/boxshots2/915692_68186.jpg</a>\n[3]: <a href=\"http://www.dylanreed.org/2007/10/15/good-god-mario-is-so-cool/\">http://www.dylanreed.org/2007/10/15/good-god-mario-is-so-cool/</a> (Super Mario Galaxy)\n[4]: <a href=\"http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog\">http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog</a> graphics/AssassinsCreed_X360_CvrShtboxart_16.jpg\n[5]: <a href=\"http://www.gameplay.pl/Galeria/Gry6/438963015.jpg\">http://www.gameplay.pl/Galeria/Gry6/438963015.jpg</a>\n[6]: <a href=\"http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog\">http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog</a> graphics/ARMTWOx360PFTfrontboxart_160w.jpg\n[7]: <a href=\"http://www.gameplay.pl/Galeria/Gry6/482545093.jpg\">http://www.gameplay.pl/Galeria/Gry6/482545093.jpg</a></p>\n<p>By no means do I think that I will buy all of these games. For one it would be ridiculous to spend that much money on games in one month. Also quite a few of these game will be good rentals or at least rent before buying games. Most likely I will get Assassins Creed, Mass Effect and Super Mario Galaxy. I may also buy Orange Box as it is three games in one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/e1d7490ee9.jpg\" alt=\"\">Just one more game for everyone to know about. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games.  Finally Mario and Sonic and friends have teamed up and made a game. Also in this game they have created a great track and field experience that has been lacking for a number of years. According to what I have read there are different wii-mote movements depending on the character. Awesome.</p>\n",

[![][2]][3]This is another epic science fiction game, this time with everyone's favorite plumber in the lead. Apparently Bowser has entered the space race and stolen Princess Peach. During the kidnapping Bowser strands Mario in space. Since Mario is Italian he isn't affected by the fact the space is a vacuum and lives to fight another day. Actually I think that he gets help from cosmic knowledge fish (or something) that helps him survive. Then it is off to fight all of Bowser's Minions to rescue the princess. Release Date: 11.12.07 \n  3. ![][4] Assassins creed is probably the game that I am most excited about. It is historical fiction at its greatest. They took a time period (the crusades), did a lot of research (most of the main characters killed during the game actually died around the same time in history) and made a beautiful game. You are this bad ass assassin who can climb walls and blend with crowds to escape. I think that they took all of the really fun parts of Splinter Cell and made it into an awesomely fun game of killing for the greater good. Release Date: 11.13.07 \n  4. ![][5] The first Raving Rabbids game was awesome. It was silly and full of multi player mini game fun. The sequel should be equally fun and full of the humor and enjoyment of the first game. Apparently it is up to you, as Rayman, to fight off the Rabbid invasion. The Ubisoft team has painstakingly digitally photographed different real world locations and inserted the rabbid invaders. You as a plunger toting cowboy of sorts are charged with taking those rabbids out. Release Date: 11.16.07![][6]\n  5. The next co-op game for Jon and I. After we beat Halo:3 we have been keep our eyes peeled for another fun co-op game. In this game you take on the role of an ex Army mercenary as you travel the world fighting in different conflicts just trying to make a buck. The game play centers around a buddy systems of the two mercenaries helping each other over and around obstacles as well as a Aggro system that allows one character to draw fire while the other sneaks around and kills the enemy. Release Date: 11.13.07 \n  6. ![][7] Finally a SCUBA diving game. I know that me and probably five other people have always thought that a decent SCUBA game has been needed for a number of years. While the main focus of this game is exploration, I have yet to see any information on dangerous creature encounters or decompression issues. That aside I think that this game could be a lot of fun as well as allowing people who are afraid or unable to dive to experience the wonders of the underwater world. Release Date: 10.29.07\n\n   [1]: http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog graphics 2/masseffectfinalboxboxart_160w.jpg\n   [2]: http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/all/boxshots2/915692_68186.jpg\n   [3]: http://www.dylanreed.org/2007/10/15/good-god-mario-is-so-cool/ (Super Mario Galaxy)\n   [4]: http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog graphics/AssassinsCreed_X360_CvrShtboxart_16.jpg\n   [5]: http://www.gameplay.pl/Galeria/Gry6/438963015.jpg\n   [6]: http://i10.photobucket.com/albums/a124/boysofsheahem/blog graphics/ARMTWOx360PFTfrontboxart_160w.jpg\n   [7]: http://www.gameplay.pl/Galeria/Gry6/482545093.jpg\n\nBy no means do I think that I will buy all of these games. For one it would be ridiculous to spend that much money on games in one month. Also quite a few of these game will be good rentals or at least rent before buying games. Most likely I will get Assassins Creed, Mass Effect and Super Mario Galaxy. I may also buy Orange Box as it is three games in one.\n\n![][8]Just one more game for everyone to know about. Mario and Sonic at the Olympic games.  Finally Mario and Sonic and friends have teamed up and made a game. Also in this game they have created a great track and field experience that has been lacking for a number of years. According to what I have read there are different wii-mote movements depending on the character. Awesome.\n\n   [8]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/e1d7490ee9.jpg\n",

MLB Power Pros for the Wii. This is an Americanized version of a Japanese baseball game that has been around forever. It is very cartoon in look and unlike most of its peers it has a really simple control scheme. Power Pros is set up to give anyone playing a chance at winning by varying the level of computer help. Pros also has a very in depth season mode where you manage a team for 10 years, drafting, trading and generally (in my case) running the team into the ground.</p>\n<p>There is also a mode of the game that has a semi role playing feel to it. This mode, called Success, is a great way to waste a lot of time as you take your created character from a lowly college ball player all the way into the minor leagues. From there you are able to draft him onto your team and use him in play on your team (which I am running into the ground, God I hope Golly G. Willikers can save us).</p>\n<p>Other modes, which I haven&rsquo;t played are home run derby, exhibition and a couple others I don&rsquo;t remember. All in all it has been a really fun game for the two hours I have played it and I will probably have to convert it from a rental to a owned game. The only sad thing is no online play, which for me is good since I would just get owned online as I do offline, but it is an awesome game. So wish me luck in the season, I play the Detroit Tigers tonight with my expansion team the Alaskan Orcas. GO WHALES!!!!!</p>\n",

Pros also has a very in depth season mode where you manage a team for 10 years, drafting, trading and generally (in my case) running the team into the ground. \n\n   [2]: https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/92f5fc526e.jpg\n\nThere is also a mode of the game that has a semi role playing feel to it. This mode, called Success, is a great way to waste a lot of time as you take your created character from a lowly college ball player all the way into the minor leagues. From there you are able to draft him onto your team and use him in play on your team (which I am running into the ground, God I hope Golly G. Willikers can save us). \n\nOther modes, which I haven't played are home run derby, exhibition and a couple others I don't remember. All in all it has been a really fun game for the two hours I have played it and I will probably have to convert it from a rental to a owned game. The only sad thing is no online play, which for me is good since I would just get owned online as I do offline, but it is an awesome game. So wish me luck in the season, I play the Detroit Tigers tonight with my expansion team the Alaskan Orcas. GO WHALES!!!!!\n",

				"title": "Four Best Ways to Die While SCUBA Diving",
				"content_html": "<p>If you are considering going or learning how to SCUBA dive here are some important things to keep in mind. It is very easy to die very quickly underwater. Here are my personal favorite ways that stupid people die underwater or shortly after getting out of the water:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A.G.E.- Arterial Gas Embolisms are horrible. The short version is that you lung pops and an air bubble gets in your blood and goes to your brain or heart and bam you are dead. This is why very SCUBA instructor will tell you to never hold your breath will diving, what they don&rsquo;t tell you is that you are in more danger of this happening in the pool during your class then diving down to 40 feet for your open water dives. How it works is that as you go down to 5' in a pool (at five feet most people can just stand up to get to the surface), you panic and stand up, automatically holding your breath(because that is what you do underwater) and pop your dead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DCS- Decompression Sickness aka The Bends is no joke. Basically as you dive your body becomes saturated with nitrogen bubbles(or whatever inert gas you are breathing) when you start to surface those bubble expand. Depending where they expand they can break bones or destroy your brain. Preventing this is as simple as coming up slowly and following the no decompression dive tables. Just to give you an idea of how much this can suck and how varied the damage can be I had two dive instructors at the college of Oceaneering who had had decompression sickness. Once of them had his back broken and one had both of his hips snapped. Sounds fun dosen&rsquo;t it. If you get bubbles in the wrong place (your brain) it can tear through that soft gray stuff leading to brain death.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Animal Stings- This one is a personal favorite of mine. It all goes back to not touching the animals. If Steve Irwin taught us anything it is that animals get pissy if you mess with them. So don&rsquo;t mess with them and you&rsquo;ll be fine. Also keep in mind that the really poisonous animals are really little. The best ones are rock fish, because they look like a rock and will kill you super fast and you won&rsquo;t even know what you did.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Differential Pressure or Delta P- This is my favorite, in fact it by far one of the scariest things I have seen. Basically these happen when the pressure between the water(where you are) and the pipe(or whatever0 is so different that you get sucked in breaking all of your bones and killing you. Typically this isn&rsquo;t something that a normal diver needs to worry about but it is just so spectacular that it couldn&rsquo;t be left off the list. There is even a video, though if you like crabs you will be sad. This is a video taken in 6000 feet of water. An undersea robot is sawing a 3mm wide slit (1/10th of an inch &hellip; remember that width) in a pipeline. The pressure inside the pipeline is 0 psi, while the pressure outside is 2700 psi, or 1.3 tons per square inch. Then a crab comes along&hellip;.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There you have it, the best ways to die underwater. Don&rsquo;t do any of these, because they all suck. The first two are survivable if you get to a decompression chamber in time, the third one all depends on what animal gets you.

I am sure that most of you have similar memories and here is the list of the best toys from my childhood(and maybe yours)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>M.A.S.K.</em>-or _M_obile _A_rmored _S_trike _K_ommand was a task force that wore masks while driving in their transforming vehicles. They where just so cool, as a child raised without a TV I didn&rsquo;t watch the cartoon, so all of my stories where made up from the mini comic that came with each toy and what ever other stories I could come up with in my mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Matchbox cars</em>- these metal die cast cars kept me busy for many an hour.

				"content_text": "\nI always remember sitting around the house playing with toys as a kid. I am sure that most of you have similar memories and here is the list of the best toys from my childhood(and maybe yours)\n\n  1. _M.A.S.K._-or _M_obile _A_rmored _S_trike _K_ommand was a task force that wore masks while driving in their transforming vehicles. They where just so cool, as a child raised without a TV I didn't watch the cartoon, so all of my stories where made up from the mini comic that came with each toy and what ever other stories I could come up with in my mind.\n  2. _Matchbox cars_- these metal die cast cars kept me busy for many an hour. The most fun was crashing them into each other and making jumps for them to go off. There where certain cars that had operable hoods, doors and trunks. Those where the best cars.\n  \n\n\n  3. _G.I. Joes_- kept me busy having little wars of my own. I always liked cobra better since their equipment was cooler. I typically bought either the underwater characters or the ninjas. Everyone knows that Snake Eyes is the best. My favorite toy I had was the hydrofoil.\n  4. _LEGOs_- not much needs to be said about them, other then Harper is a LEGO stealer. The best sets where always the castle sets and I could play with those for hours and hours. If you where one of those really cool kids(like Harper) you could build whatever you want.\n  5. _Dinoriders_- By far the coolest idea for a toy that I remember. It was pretty self explanatory and yet incredibly fun.

It was a really fun trip, aside from the mantis attack, so I figured I would give you the five things that we really enjoyed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>**<em>Royal Gorge Bridge:</em>**What can you say about a bridge that is 1053 feet above a river, <img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/907af24db7.jpg\" alt=\"\">was built on a bet and cost only $350,000 to build.  It was pretty neat. Other then the fears of the bridge collapsing on our way across and me neglecting to tell Sarah that  they allow cars on the bridge. We took some pictures for scale as well as seeing long horned cattle on the other side. I think that this is one of the attractions that everyone should do when they are in Colorado, it is so neat to be on a suspension bridge  in the middle of the mountains. <img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/e24860c32a.jpg\" alt=\"\">The story of the Bridge is that two Texans, of course, made a bet that one of them couldn&rsquo;t build a bridge across the gorge. So of course they where able to and so in Colorado we have a bridge that you can take to get no where.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong><em>Cave of the Winds:</em></strong> We did this on the last day of our vacation and I think that it might have been my favorite part of the trip. The<img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/83557a5e57.jpg\" alt=\"\"> night before we had avoided going to the hotel we booked, it looked like a crack den, and drove all night to get to a hotel with a vacancy. So after a quick breakfast,  included in the stay, we where off to the cave of the winds. Once we had arrived and purchased our tickets it was time to hell about Manitou Springs waiting for out tour to start.We arrived back at the cave about 30 minutes before our tour and had to wait about 25 for the guide to show up. We had opted to do the lantern tour, which is a tour into the less traveled parts of the cave carrying kerosene &ldquo;<img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/f7424fd4f3.jpg\" alt=\"\">candles&rdquo; in buckets. As we traveled into the caves out guide told us ghost stories and it was a really fun time.  We enjoyed learning the history of the cave and the area.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong><em>Royal Gorge Bridge:</em></strong> This was the first thing we did after leaving on Frid<img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/ea6830eaef.jpg\" alt=\"\">ay. We drove up and made it to the Depot about one hour prior to our train leaving. Since Sarah had her clot we have been very conscience of sitting for to long so we where off to take a walk and take pictures.  After an hour and 30 some pictures later we went a boarded the train.  Our only disappointment with this train ride was that since we did the lunch train we where sat with another couple. Man they where annoying. Luckily after lunch Sarah and I went and looked out on the open air car and where able to avoid them for a good part of the ride. The beautiful trip u<img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/ea3b0c4017.jpg\" alt=\"\">p was interesting because  you can see the old Canon City water pipe, which was made of wood and laid by convicts, as well as passing under the bridge. On the way back they where nice enough to pause under the bridge for 20 minutes so everyone can get twenty or so under bridge shots.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong><em>Royal Gorge Incline Railroad:</em></strong> This railroad is actually an elevator that goes down the side of th<img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/5744a9388a.jpg\" alt=\"\">e mountain. It is really pretty cool and a much better way to get up or down a mountain then walking. The ride down is pretty exciting because you are standing in a car looking across at the other side of the gorge. When you arrive at the bottom you are right beside the Arkansas river and there is a nice area to take pictures of the water way. The ride up is interesting because you are traveling  backwards and the car coming down sneaks up on you.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><em><strong>Great Sand Dunes:</strong></em> Are and will always be GREAT!! I had been to<img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/5196d87b1b.jpg\" alt=\"\"> the Dunes once before about eight years ago and had forgotten how big they are. I told Sarah that we should have no problem reaching the top. Shouldn&rsquo;t take us more then an hour I said. I was so wrong. One thing to remember, that we forgot, is to bring sno-disc type sleds or a snowboard. With these you can surf or slide the dunes, we watched a lot of people do this and it looked like fun. Sarah and I did a pretty good job hiking up the dunes and found ourselves about a third of the way to the top.  <img src=\"https://dylan.blog/uploads/2025/bc6f124837.jpg\" alt=\"\"> What we found funny is that we had this group that followed us most of the way to the top. Everytime we would stop they would catch up and stand in front of us until we moved, this happened three or four times until Sarah pushed them off the dunes we finally stopped moving. Of all of the wonderful natural attractions that Colorado has the Great Sand Dunes has to be pretty far up there on the list. They are so cool because they are unexpected. They are a wonderful little desert in the middle of the mountains. Awesome.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So next time you find yourself thinking &ldquo;Man, I have to go to Southern Colorado, that place is so lame&rdquo;.

Since very few games receive higher then 85/100 average this is crazy(the new Zelda got 94.3/100). I have read some user reviews of the demo saying that they wanted more guns or that they didn&rsquo;t like the way the game was presented.

Unfortunately for you the Big Daddies are bad ass mothers who don&rsquo;t take no crap from no buddy, basically as soon as you attack them to get at the Little Sister they try and usually succeed in killing you. I have yet to encounter one in the demo, in fact I am unsure if I even will, and I am pretty sure that the first time I encounter them I will get my ass handed to you.</p>\n<p>The beauty of this game is that, supposedly, you don&rsquo;t have to kill a single Little Sister to complete the game.

I feel really confident about taking this test since I did so good on the class and all of the exam prep stuff. In fact I didn&rsquo;t actually study until I was done with exam prep and had gotten the go ahead to take the test.</p>\n<p>I have spent the afternoon going over the true and false over and over again, focusing on ones that I have previously had a hard time on. I am now feeling quite confident about the test but am still freaking out about taking it. I feel bad for Sarah because she is going to have to deal with me all of tonight and most of tomorrow.</p>\n<p>As I was doing the true or false I was also reading Harry Potter 7 and enjoying it. I would study for 30minutes and then read for 15minutes or a chapter which ever was first. Overall I found it to be a really good book, probably not my favorite of the series but easily in the top 7, maybe even in the top 3. What killed it from being my favorite was some of the questions that JK Rowling said she was going to answer and I was unable to figure out as well as the epilogue. The epilogue itself almost kills the book for me, it leaves more questions then it answers, which is god if she is going to write more books but bad if we are going to be left wondering forever.</p>\n<p>Back to the test</p>\n<p>It is 154+ questions that I have about 4 hours to complete. There are two portions of the test. The national portion, which I believe is first, is 80 questions, plus up to 5 experimental questions. They give you 2hours on the national portion. The second part is the State portion which is 74 questions, plus up to 5 more experimental questions. You get 1hour and 50minutes for the State portion.</p>\n<p>The funny part about the two portions of the test it that Colorado is more progressive then most states and so a lot of things vary between the two tests. For example, on the national portion of the test when prorating an amount you use 12 months with 30 days each for a total of 360 days in a year. On the state portion on the test it is 12 months with however many days they really have for 365 total days. Also to confuse things even more, on the national test it is assumed that the seller owns the day of closing and so that is added to their days on a proration. On the state protion of the test closings are owned by the buyer.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few other things, such as Colorado is a deed of trust state, with the deed of trust being held by a public trustee. This means that if you fail to pay your mortgage, the bank goes to the public trustee and they foreclose without having to go to the courts. It is possible to have the Deed of Trust held by a private trustee but then to foreclose it has to go through the court system. As if that wasn&rsquo;t tricky enough part of the eastern part of the state near Kansas, so all of the eastern parts of the state, use the Torrens system of conveying ownership in Real Property. This means that to transfer property you have to go to a court and a judge transfers the property.</p>\n<p>This is just the tip of the random crap that is now crammed into my brain. No wonder everything tastes bad, because all of that crap is dripping into my mouth. The test is tomorrow starting at 10am so wish me luck and if everything goes like it did during pretests I should be done in time for lunch.</p>\n<p>AHHHHHHH!</p>\n",

Prior to getting on the big straight away I was still in third having caught the second place car and then spun out on a turn. ![][1]\n\n   [1]: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1141/552334021_bfabd71e29.jpg?v=0\n\nFinally on the straight I was able to catch the number one car, I passed him on the inside and went to shift from 5th to 6th when it happened. I miss pressed the shifting button, in fact i missed the up shift button all together and hit the Emergency brake. Since I was turning in front of the car I just passed to get back in the racing line, this caused me to hit the wall and start the destruction of my car.\n\n  \nHere is the timeline of the pictures:\n\nI hit the wall, notice the glass flying around as I break out all of my windows.![][2]\n\n   [2]: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1106/552111202_5db9976209.jpg?v=0\n\nNext as I spin away from the wall I am rear ended by the car I just passed, losing my spoiler.\n\n![][3]\n\n   [3]: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1355/552111358_9415349bd6.jpg?v=0\n\nThen I start to straighten out, thinking everything is A-ok. Notice the red car.\n\n![][4]\n\n   [4]: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1010/552111508_54f4919bef.jpg?v=0\n\nFinally I am hit by the red car and almost flipped(I was so disappointed)\n\n![][5]\n\n   [5]: http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1410/552334599_69b54d43c0.jpg?v=0\n\nAfter all of this, I was passed by every car as I tried to correct my path. I then but it into gear and went to try and catch up to at least the seventh place car(the red car the tried to kill me).\n\nLuckily for me since I only hit my front end once, there was very little damage to my engine and the red car after hitting me destroyed theirs. So after a frantic lap playing catch up I was able to pass him just before going across the finish line.\n",

I will start with races.</p>\n<p>I personally either love or hate the fantasy races that are usually around in fantasy universes. I tend to hate the typical ones like elves and dwarves, but I like ones created for the specific universe like the Kender from Dragonlance books or the Tines from A Deepness in the Sky. I tend to enjoy books that the races are more modified humans then fantastical creatures. A prime example of this is David Eddings books, he has been criticized for basing his races of people on historical civilizations. Each race is a stereotype, but within each race there are exceptions. I think that this is a great way to introduce races with out having to explain the different ends and outs of their society. By using visual clues about the way their architecture is and how they fight, it automatically gets a certain civilization into your head allowing you to understand motivations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Races: Need to either be all human based or if fantasy based there needs to be one or two really well thought out new races.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also really like the characters to have flaws. I really enjoy it when characters are not the best at everything or undefeatable. I rather enjoy it when Vlad Taltos gets killed or when Raistlen has to stop casting incredible spells because of the physical limitations of his body. One of the greatest &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; I have found in a fantasy series is Drizzt from the Dark Elf Trilogy. He, unlike his fellow dark elves&quot; isn&rsquo;t evil and wants nothing more then to be accepted somewhere. Unfortunately for him the Dark Elves are quite evil and hated by pretty much all other races. R.A. Salvatore does a great job of making you love Drizzt and root for him as the ultimate underdog.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Characters: The main heroes need to have flaws that actually effect the outcome of the story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another thing that all fantasy novels seem to have is a pantheon system. I have seen these systems over done to the point of the gods themselves fighting alongside the heroes to the gods remaining aloof and only acting through the hero&rsquo;s. I truly enjoy the Vlad Taltos series since the gods are not necessarily ultimate beings, they are instead just another &ldquo;race&rdquo; that occupies the world. This gives the gods a more down to earth character and makes them more enjoyable to read about. The rare exception seems to be the books that have gods much like the real world, people prey to said gods and the gods may or may not do anything, it is more about interpretation then actual action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gods: If they are aloof or a non-entity I tend to like it better, though a really well thought out system can be appealing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A lot of fantasy novels seem to focus so much on combat that I lose interest pretty quick. I enjoy a good battle every now and then, but I do not need a graphic description of how someone&rsquo;s face melted off. Just say that their face melted off. My imagination can do the rest. I really enjoy books that give you the basics and provide for your mind to do the rest. The same goes for sex. I really don&rsquo;t need porn in the middle of my book. A little sex is fine but when it starts to border on a romance novel my brain shuts down and I stop caring.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fighting and Sex: Nice and easy, let my mind do the work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recently read the Liveship Traders series and I really enjoy sailing in books.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work in Mozilla or IE7, I don't know what I did wrong since the example on alistapart works fine in all browsers. \n\n   [2]: http://alistapart.com/articles/sprites\n   [3]: http://www.alistapart.com\n   [4]: http://alistapart.com/d/sprites/ala-image3.html\n   [5]: http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/test.html\n\nBasically, I need help. I can figure it out. [Here][6] is a mockup of the new API site that works in IE6, that I would like to get to work across most if not all platforms. If you have any idea on what I need to do or even just something you think I should try, let me know. [Here][7] and [Here][8] are the CSS files. \n\n   [6]: http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/index.html\n   [7]: http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/test.css\n   [8]: http://ads.dylanreed.org/fancyselector/1.css\n\nDo I need to combine those or is it because my menu is in a DIV instead of just on a page? Basically I am at the limit of my CSS knowledge and want to get this figured out.\n\nThanks in advance for any and all help.\n",

I think that what I need is the ability to apply my knowledge in a way that will get me a degree that I can apply to my real life. Here is a breakdown of my skills:</p>\n<p>Html: I have a very, VERY basic knowledge of html, CSS and PHP. I find that this allows me to do various things around the Internet and prevents me from using programs such as FrontPage to create bad websites. I also find that this knowledge causes me to want to learn more so that I can do more and have to ask <a href=\"http://nata2.org\">Harper</a> for help less often.</p>\n<p>Sewing: I am able to sew pretty well, it basically comes down to being able to follow directions and problem solve the parts of the pattern I might not know how to do. I sometimes blunder and have to remove stitches and sew the seam again, but for the most part I am able to get my <a href=\"http://imadeit.myshopify.com\">purses</a> made.</p>\n<p>Entertainment: This is a whole subset of my life and I unfortunately am not the master of any of the specific skills involved. Part of this comes from the fact that I just jumped into entertaining and didn&rsquo;t have an effective method of training myself. It dosen&rsquo;t matter if it is card tricks or juggling or unicycling, I need much more practice then I bother to do and while I am able to get by as an entertainer I find that while I am watching other entertainers I feel strangely inadequate.</p>\n<p>Diving: I went to <a href=\"http://www.natpoly.edu/\">commercial diving sch</a>ool so I have quite a bit of book knowledge about the ins and outs of diving, however, I dive infrequently and haven&rsquo;t taken my recreational diving skills very far. I basically just like to be underwater and feel confident that I am able to plan for any emergency underwater by planning.</p>\n<p>Welding: I enjoy welding and do ok at it but I know that none of my welds would pass any weld test. I defiantly blew a great learning opportunity while at dive school by not pursuing welding like I should have. I could probably with a little more practice get my 2G certification, but since most of the welding I do is very basic and dosen&rsquo;t need to hold up by any standards, I don&rsquo;t worry about it.</p>\n<p>Dance: I have taken about 5 years of ballet and jazz classes. While I think that this has improved my ability to move while entertaining I am under no illusions that I am a great dancer. I am just lucky that I have good muscle memory so I am able to do ok at ballet. Oh and I like to jump.</p>\n<p>Gymnastics: I took a lot of tumbling classes while I was in high school and continued for a couple of years out of high school. I found tumbling to by easy for me since I had no fear. I was working on double front and back flips when I hurt myself. That ruined gymnastics for me since I know had fear, though I think that I would like to go back and get back in tumbling shape.</p>\n<p>I know that there are other things that I can do, I just can&rsquo;t remember them right now. I think that I enjoy be a Jack of all trades and a master of none. It allows me to act in any situation and allows me to solve problems quickly and creatively. I always tell my self that I am going to focus on one area and learn more and get a broader knowledge of a subject, but deep down inside I know that I will probably just continue to grow all of my skills slowly but all at the same time.</p>\n",

While I think that this has improved my ability to move while entertaining I am under no illusions that I am a great dancer. I am just lucky that I have good muscle memory so I am able to do ok at ballet. Oh and I like to jump.\n\nGymnastics: I took a lot of tumbling classes while I was in high school and continued for a couple of years out of high school. I found tumbling to by easy for me since I had no fear. I was working on double front and back flips when I hurt myself. That ruined gymnastics for me since I know had fear, though I think that I would like to go back and get back in tumbling shape.\n\nI know that there are other things that I can do, I just can't remember them right now. I think that I enjoy be a Jack of all trades and a master of none. It allows me to act in any situation and allows me to solve problems quickly and creatively. I always tell my self that I am going to focus on one area and learn more and get a broader knowledge of a subject, but deep down inside I know that I will probably just continue to grow all of my skills slowly but all at the same time.\n",

It leads you to believe that you will be saving money and then it ends up not saving you anything. It seems to me that if they wanted to make this card available with and immediate savings, then it would make sense. However since you get the $30 after you make your first purchase, which isn&rsquo;t your current transaction, I find it to be misleading and frustrating.<br>\nOther issues with Amazon.com are quite simple. I think that I would enjoy shopping at Amazon.com more if I was allowed to pick which categories I was interested in. I pretty much shop online for books, DVDs and electronics. Other then that I don&rsquo;t care. I hate when I go to the Amazon.com homepage and find recommendations for kitchen gadgets or clothes. I wish I could set up a custom homepage, or even just put something in my account that says &ldquo;recommend these things&rdquo; and poof I would have the recommendations I needed. The main reason I think that this would be beneficial to Amazon.com because it would alleviate what I find to be a very frustrating shopping process. I want to go to an eCommerce site and find what I want easily, I want the options to be minimal.</p>\n<p>I understand that Amazon.com is a huge company and it sells everything, however, if you where able to create a custom homepage\\recommendation page a la the Google Homepage, I think that it would allow people to find things that they want quickly. Also as with the Ellusionist.com website, I wish that Amazon would make it so there where fewer steps to check out. Since they feel the need to try and get that last impulse buy, they place a page full of recommendations prior to letting you finishing your order.</p>\n<p>Another thing that could use some help is the fact that when you are logged in it always asks to confirm your log-in prior to purchasing, I have no problem with needing to confirm my information so others can&rsquo;t order stuff on my saved credit cards, I would like it more if the log-in itself wasn&rsquo;t a whole screen, rather a flashing of color highlighting the need for a password. This would allow you to enter it and not have to wait for another screen to load. Also I would think that this would further help prevent any security vulnerability since it would be harder to recreate the content that the person ordered and the amazon generated recommendations then to recreate the generic <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/cart/view.html/ref=ord_cart_shr/002-1588246-5953645\">log-in page.</a></p>\n",

I want to go to an eCommerce site and find what I want easily, I want the options to be minimal.\n\nI understand that Amazon.com is a huge company and it sells everything, however, if you where able to create a custom homepage\\recommendation page a la the Google Homepage, I think that it would allow people to find things that they want quickly. Also as with the Ellusionist.com website, I wish that Amazon would make it so there where fewer steps to check out. Since they feel the need to try and get that last impulse buy, they place a page full of recommendations prior to letting you finishing your order.\n\nAnother thing that could use some help is the fact that when you are logged in it always asks to confirm your log-in prior to purchasing, I have no problem with needing to confirm my information so others can't order stuff on my saved credit cards, I would like it more if the log-in itself wasn't a whole screen, rather a flashing of color highlighting the need for a password. This would allow you to enter it and not have to wait for another screen to load. Also I would think that this would further help prevent any security vulnerability since it would be harder to recreate the content that the person ordered and the amazon generated recommendations then to recreate the generic [log-in page.][3]\n\n   [3]: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cart/view.html/ref=ord_cart_shr/002-1588246-5953645\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.ellusionist.com\">Ellusionist.com</a> is a site that has capitalized on the popularity of David Blaine and the whole street magic thing. They are a bunch of really good magicians who seem to grasp the importance of a webpresence. They sell magic tricks and DVDs as well as any supplies that you might need to do magic. Their site is very well laid out and very fancy looking. However, in my opinion there are some minor problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>One</strong>- They have there <a href=\"http://www.ellusionist.com/cart/category.php?cat=80\">coin trick DVDs</a> divided up into categories and then by skill level. This makes sense except that in certain categories the same trick ends up in both categories. This is just confusing, if I was looking for magic tricks for someone and I knew they where just starting out in magic I would look in the beginnercategory. In the beginner category of coin tricks there is a trick call Silver Dream and a trick called Fraud. Both of these tricks also show up under the intermediate and up category as well. This seems to be a cheap trick to sell certain tricks, in fact, I have noticed that they only seem to do this on tricks and DVDs thatEllusionist has produced. Basically, if it is a beginner trick put it in the beginner category if is harder then that put it in the intermediate category.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two</strong>- They have no other <a href=\"http://www.ellusionist.com/cart/category.php?cat=95\">categories</a> of tricks divided that way. Under card tricks it doesn&rsquo;t give the option to view easier tricks or harder tricks. I think that if you are going to offer the feature in one area, then it should be in all areas. I find it frustrating when I am looking for a trick and I want amoderately hard trick I want to be able to find tricks of that general difficulty level so I don&rsquo;t order a trick that is way out of my league.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>``</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Three</strong>- Another thing that really gets me about the site is the preview videos. I use <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\">Mozilla FireFox</a> almost exclusively, as such I open a lot of tabs while browsing. Since they have preview videos on almost every big trick I get a sound overload. Plus they have two separate video formats that they use. <a href=\"http://www.ellusionist.com/order/Stigmata-by-Wayne-Houchin.php?cat=95\">One</a> starts as it is loading and the <a href=\"http://www.ellusionist.com/order/KAOS-Card-Through-Window_Garcia.php?cat=95\">other</a> where you have to click on the play button. I prefer the ones that let me choose when it plays. That way I can open up all of the tricks I want and I can listen to my music until I want to watch the previews. A lot of times I don&rsquo;t even watch the video. If the description doesn&rsquo;t grab me I don&rsquo;t need to see a video that is some really talented magician doing the trick after years of practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Four</strong>- They allow you to have an account for their store. This is a great feature that most eStore sites have. I would like the system to be smarter. I want it to know what I have ordered, not so much to show me my order history but to make smarter recommendations . When you add something to your cart it <a href=\"http://www.ellusionist.com/order/ups/KAOS-Upsell.php\">suggests</a> things that you might enjoy with the item you ordered. That by itself is a great feature but I dislike being told that I might enjoy things that I have already purchased. I think that it would be better to suggest common items that you need to replace, like playing cards or sharpies, or even better make the suggestions less obtrusive so you can ignore them without clicking on another button. The feature would be great if you didn&rsquo;t have to view it in order to check out. If it was a sidebar you could view your order and move on.

				"title": "Tips for Creative Play from a Professional Clown",
				"content_html": "<p>by Dylan the Clown, with a little help from his mom.<strong>_<br>\n_</strong>_<br>\n_1. <strong>Give yourself permission to be a kid</strong>- Don&rsquo;t feel that since you are a doctor, grocery clerk or garbage person, or a parent that you have to act mature and adult all of the time. Allowing yourself 30 minutes a day to play with your children will relax you and build a better relationship with your children than all the gifts and money in the world. Plus the more that you allow your children to see you having fun the more they will realize that it is okay to have fun themselves.<br>\n2. <strong>Creative play can be anything</strong>- I think that the best way to start is by reading. Read to your children so that they are introduced to story telling at an early age. This will make playing easier for them as well as you since most imaginary play is just acting out or retelling a story.  As they get older and you start reading longer books, every night when you stop reading for the night ask them what they think is going to happen next. Sometimes their endings to a book might be better than the authors.  This enhances their imagination which furthers their creativity.<br>\n3. **Encourage your children to play and talk about it- **When you see you children playing with a toy, for instance a car, ask them what is going on. You will be pleasantly surprised by their answer. Most children have a whole universe they use when playing with one toy and then a whole different one when playing with another toy. By asking them to tell you the story of their play, your children will use their imagination, vocabulary and other important communication skills.  Your child will then have an easier time writing, reading and talking in school.<br>\n4. <strong>Turn off the T.V.</strong> - It is hard to give undivided attention to any activity while the T.V. is on. So set aside time to play with your children without the interruption of T.V., as well as the phone, housework, etc.   You don&rsquo;t want playing with your child to be a chore.  Playing, if you remember from your own childhood, should be a fun time.<br>\n5. <strong>You can play anywhere</strong>- Make ordinary activities into an adventure. Going to the grocery store can be a mission to the moon, the cart is a space ship, and you have to get all of the ingredients for the space station&rsquo;s kitchen. Another great thing about making the grocery store into a game is that you can incorporate reading and math skills into the adventure. Ask your children to read the list, with or without your help, and then have them pick out the least expensive brand or find one for a certain amount.

				"content_text": "\nby Dylan the Clown, with a little help from his mom.**_  \n_**_  \n_1. **Give yourself permission to be a kid**- Don't feel that since you are a doctor, grocery clerk or garbage person, or a parent that you have to act mature and adult all of the time. Allowing yourself 30 minutes a day to play with your children will relax you and build a better relationship with your children than all the gifts and money in the world. Plus the more that you allow your children to see you having fun the more they will realize that it is okay to have fun themselves.  \n2. **Creative play can be anything**- I think that the best way to start is by reading. Read to your children so that they are introduced to story telling at an early age. This will make playing easier for them as well as you since most imaginary play is just acting out or retelling a story.  As they get older and you start reading longer books, every night when you stop reading for the night ask them what they think is going to happen next. Sometimes their endings to a book might be better than the authors.  This enhances their imagination which furthers their creativity.  \n3. **Encourage your children to play and talk about it- **When you see you children playing with a toy, for instance a car, ask them what is going on. You will be pleasantly surprised by their answer. Most children have a whole universe they use when playing with one toy and then a whole different one when playing with another toy. By asking them to tell you the story of their play, your children will use their imagination, vocabulary and other important communication skills.  Your child will then have an easier time writing, reading and talking in school.   \n4. **Turn off the T.V.** - It is hard to give undivided attention to any activity while the T.V. is on. So set aside time to play with your children without the interruption of T.V., as well as the phone, housework, etc.   You don't want playing with your child to be a chore.  Playing, if you remember from your own childhood, should be a fun time.  \n5. **You can play anywhere**- Make ordinary activities into an adventure. Going to the grocery store can be a mission to the moon, the cart is a space ship, and you have to get all of the ingredients for the space station's kitchen. Another great thing about making the grocery store into a game is that you can incorporate reading and math skills into the adventure. Ask your children to read the list, with or without your help, and then have them pick out the least expensive brand or find one for a certain amount. Or for younger kids have them count the items on the list and then count the items in the cart.  Not only will your children be entertained, but the grocery store trip will be enjoyable for everyone without the usual squabble over what to buy.  \n  Creative Play for children is a must, it helps children become creative, fun loving life long learners  Just remember to laugh, be goofy, have water fights, cook together, read together, hug and wrestle, listen to music and enjoy the time with your children. \n",

This is on top of our HOA liaison being out of the office due to a surgery. This means my week was supposed to be my walk around tours in the beautiful Colorado weather.

				"content_html": "<p>So recently a new role playing game has been released for the PC. It is the <a href=\"http://www.columbinegame.com/\">Super Columbine Massacre RPG</a>. I applaud the creator for putting forth his take on the events as well as taking the time to research what happened. I would say that a lot of people misunderstand the purpose of the game and I think that that is sad.</p>\n<p>A lot of people are quite upset about the game. While I can see why this game would offend people directly involved in the shooting, I think that those people&rsquo;s anger could be better aimed at games that don&rsquo;t have a message within their violence. The games creator had this to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/19/AR2006051901979.html\">say</a>:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not advocating shooting up your school, and I don&rsquo;t know how many times I can say that and no one will listen.

				"content_text": "\nSo recently a new role playing game has been released for the PC. It is the [Super Columbine Massacre RPG][1]. I applaud the creator for putting forth his take on the events as well as taking the time to research what happened. I would say that a lot of people misunderstand the purpose of the game and I think that that is sad.\n\n   [1]: http://www.columbinegame.com/\n\nA lot of people are quite upset about the game. While I can see why this game would offend people directly involved in the shooting, I think that those people's anger could be better aimed at games that don't have a message within their violence. The games creator had this to [say][2]:\n\n   [2]: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/19/AR2006051901979.html\n\n\"I'm not advocating shooting up your school, and I don't know how many times I can say that and no one will listen. This game does not glorify school shootings. If you make it far enough in the game, you see very graphic photos of Eric and Dylan lying dead.\" Ledonne said. \"I can't think of a more effective way to confront their actions and the consequences those actions had.\"\n\nI think that it is a possibility that this was the author of the games outlet about school violence.

They had been told to drop of a <a href=\"http://www.gameready.com/products/images/CntrlUnit.jpg\">Game Ready Super Awesome Cold Therapy Machine</a>. It is awesome.

I tried tramp makeup both years I was at Moosecamp and while I enjoyed it both times my character doesn&rsquo;t really fit the bill as a sad tramp or happy hobo, maybe hyper hobo but that is a different story. As I look back on my seven years of clowning I notice many differences in what my clown face and views on clowning have changed.</p>\n<p>When I started out I tried to be the clown that Creative Clowning wanted me to be. I took that book to be &ldquo;the&rdquo; course in clowning. I started at chapter one and followed it all the way through. I learned almost every skill in that book within the first 4 months of my career. In doing this I became a Joey of all trades, master of none. Also during this time I worked and worked on my makeup. I had done theatre all through high school and since I started clowning my senior year my drama teachers helped me with the technical side of makeup. Looking at pictures from my first year of clowning I wonder what I was thinking. I was scary I just didn&rsquo;t know it.</p>\n<p>So I went to Moosecamp &lsquo;99 and it is a good thing I did. Originally I was going to partake in the circus course with Frosty Little. But on arriving and seeing the caliber of clowns that where there I paniced and instead took clowning 101. In clowning 101 I was able to learn how to do clown makeup not stage makeup. I went from being a very harsh outlined clown face to a more natural looking soft face. And by natural I mean for a clown.</p>\n<p>At Moosecamp I also got my first wig\\skullcap and Moosburger costume. I bough my costume off the rack and it was what I wanted my character to be not what it has turned into. I think that all new clowns should understand that a clown character is never what you expect it to be. Most people I talked to at Moosecamp said that they act more subdued out of clown and are zany in their clown. For me this was the opposite. I suffer from ADHD, which means I am off the wall all the time and have a hard time focusing on concrete things in my day-to-day life. However when I am in clown I am calm, quiet and subdued.</p>\n<p>Anyway back to makeup. After I left Mooscamp in &lsquo;99 my make up stayed about the same with subtle little changes to eyebrow shape and lips. Then Moosecamp 2000 I took the hospital clown class and learned a whole new makeup design with the help of Joe Barney. Once I learned this light version of my hospital makeup I decided to work on a light version of my regular auguste. To me that meant first getting rid of the base auguste color and then about two years ago I stopped using makeup all together and just went out wearing my nose. So I went from full makeup every time to no makeup no wig in two years.</p>\n<p>Well, about a year ago I started focusing on a different type of clowning, which I call street clowning. Street clowning was inspired by a combination of David Blaines &ldquo;Street Magic&rdquo; shows and the movie &ldquo;Rize&rdquo;. Basically it consists of taking the clowning to the people rather then waiting for the people to come to you. Once I started focusing on that I realized that part of being a clown was the makeup. I figured that if I was going to bring entertainment to the street I need a persona to match. So off I was searching for a character.</p>\n<p>I started by trying to find an edgy wig. I tried a modified grinch wig and a new nose. AfterÃ‚Â I got both of those I tried a new makeup. It was ok but it lacked the expressiveness of my old face and I thought that the wig was too bright and evil looking to fit the persona I wanted. After trying three or four faces I just decided to try my old face again. I was hooked again. I remembered how expressive it was and how it fit my face. It just goes to show that a good clown face is like a glove.</p>\n<p>Costume wise I was still using my first Mooseburger costume and since I paid so much for it I felt I still needed to use it. That lasted about 4 weeks. I ordered a custom costume from Mooseburger figuring the expense was worth the quality and fit. After a few mishaps and misunderstandings on my part I received my costume.Ã‚Â  It fits how I want it to and works well with my clown. It allows for great movement and still looks big.</p>\n<p>Depending on the event I have multiple costumes that I wear ranging from my main &ldquo;agent&rdquo; suit to a Salvation Army blue vest\\pants combo. I find that no matter when and where I am performing I never get so hot that I am uncomfortable. I find that I get a better response when I am all decked out in full clown gear then when I dumb down my clown by opting out of a wig or part of my costume for my comfort. I believe that if you are willing to entertain people then you need to go all or go home. I realize that this isn&rsquo;t for everyone but I feel that to give my best I need to look my best and have thought out every part of my costume.</p>\n<p>For instance wigs: if your clown normally wears a wig, not having it on so you can just wear a baseball cap seems like the easy way out. I admit less then a year ago I did the same thing and though I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else cared I did. I felt out of character and out of place.</p>\n<p>With make up: I understand the idea of the light makeup, I think that it is great if you have skin problems or have a hard time putting on makeup due to arthritis or other injuries. However, if you do a light makeup make it look good, don&rsquo;t just quickly do muzzle and eyes and be done, take the same amount of time as you would doing full makeup so even though you are light. -</p>\n<p>Costume wise: make sure that your costume fits where it needs to fit and allows you to do the things that you need to do. Almost more important then that make sure you are wearing what your clown would wear. For instance my character is loosely based on Inspector Clouseau from the original Pink Panther series. I am a lucky incompetent, who miraculously gets by without hurting himself. So my costume is pants, a vest and a really short long tie. I am also wearing a hat that I have had for years that gives me the P.I. look.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "\nHere are my opinions on clown makeup and faces. I started out as an auguste and have never tried to be anything else. I tried tramp makeup both years I was at Moosecamp and while I enjoyed it both times my character doesn't really fit the bill as a sad tramp or happy hobo, maybe hyper hobo but that is a different story. As I look back on my seven years of clowning I notice many differences in what my clown face and views on clowning have changed.\n\nWhen I started out I tried to be the clown that Creative Clowning wanted me to be. I took that book to be \"the\" course in clowning. I started at chapter one and followed it all the way through. I learned almost every skill in that book within the first 4 months of my career. In doing this I became a Joey of all trades, master of none. Also during this time I worked and worked on my makeup. I had done theatre all through high school and since I started clowning my senior year my drama teachers helped me with the technical side of makeup.

I was al excited to go and perform at the festival when I realized that it happens to be on the weekend of my Mother-in-laws wedding. This was not frustrating.</p>\n<p>What was frustrating was when I decided to look into what was going on at another local fest that shall remain nameless. When I look on the website I found that they had chosen to go with other entertainers to do balloons at the fest, even though I had done it the past 5 years. Now, I understand that I did not have a contract and that they are free to choose whomever they wish, however, that festival has been somewhat of a tradition since the only year I have missed was the year that I was in California going to commercial diving school.</p>\n<p>It turns out that they hired my competition to entertain and it just so happens that the person who runs the competition is friends with the person who chooses the performers.

I haven&rsquo;t heard from you about the FESTIVAL this year and was wondering what is going on. I had talked with you before I started doing ANOTHER FESTIVAL this last November. In our discussion I had requested payment to do that event. You said that it was more of a volunteer event but that you would use me and possibly my wife in the coming festival season. You mentioned both Cinco de Mayo and the FESTIVAL. I find it very disappointing that you didn&rsquo;t honor what you said. I have enjoyed performing at the FESTIVAL for the past 6 years. Another year when you didn&rsquo;t hire me I just showed up because it is an event that I enjoy doing. During that year you said that I was fine to be there performing as long as I didn&rsquo;t make Balloon Animals so I didn&rsquo;t compete with the people who had paid to be there (THE COMPETITION).</p>\n<p>I understand that it is possible that you had forgotten what had been said, however I feel that I have been slighted and I would like to know why. Did I do something to cause you to not want to use me as an entertainer? Last year when you gave me my check for the FESTIVAL you seemed to be happy with the service I provided, if you weren&rsquo;t I would like to know how I can improve those services so I can work with you in the future.</p>\n<p>I would also like to know why you didn&rsquo;t even try to contact me about the FESTIVAL to provide wondering balloon art like you have THE COMPETITION doing?

When I returned (after taging another vehicle) they where still standing around, so I got out my tags and started filling them out to place on their cars. This really set baldy off. He started yelling that if I put the tag on the car he woul call the cops since I was defacing his car. So I told him that if he where to move the car their would be no need for the tag. He said he wouldn&rsquo;t and decided to call the cops. So I saton the curb and waited for the cops to come. To make a long story short the cops called and said that I was right and the other people where wrong. So HAHAHA baldy and hi friends</p>\n",

You can do full color embroidery with as many colors as you want.

Hopefully this is a trend that will continue so I can follow my dream of opening up a sweat shop of my very own someday in a third world country. Just kidding</p>\n<p>But seriously</p>\n<p>No I&rsquo;m kidding</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>My cell phone still sucks. Let that be a lesson to all that Cingular Wireless in my opinion has the worst costumer service and the worst cell phone service of any other company that I or anyone I have talked to has seen. You hear that Cingular I told you I would put it on a website. Sure it isn&rsquo;t CingularSucks.com like I originally planned. But it is up. HA.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With my current problem I called Cingular and spoke to someone very helpful who we shall call Kate(we will call her that because that is what she told me her name was). She told me that they had been having problems with SIM cards going bad. So she sent me to a local Cingular store to get a new one. They traded out my SIM card and my service did not improve so I called back.</p>\n<p>On my second call I got a man who we will call Asshole McGee (because that is what I thought he said his name wasÃ¯Â¿Â½can&rsquo;t be sure though). I explained my problem to him again, because even though they say they are noting it on your account, they are not, and he said that my only option was to send him $120 dollars for a new bottom of the line phone. Now by send I mean give him a credit card. What I did then was point out that I can cancel my service with Cingular Wireless for $150 then sign on with another carrier keeping my number and getting a free razr phone for just the $36 activation fee. So for just $66 more I can get a top of the line phone.</p>\n<p>He was all like &ldquo;So you want to cancel your service?&rdquo; And I was all &ldquo;Not really I just don&rsquo;t want to get screwed by you guys.&rdquo; and he was all Ã¯Â¿Â½You got screwed by us when you signed your contract.&quot; And I was all &ldquo;whatever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So that is that.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>XBOX 360,So I might get an Xbox 360. I am so excited. Not only can I play games on it but it will also turn into out new DVD player since we are currently using the PS@ with a wired controller to do all of the DVD watching.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am in a panic because I don&rsquo;t know what game to get, or which bundle to get or anything I am like a chicken who lost its head while crossing the road. Today I thought that the best thing to do would be to get the GTA three pack, however that was for the regular XBOX so if I was going to do that why not just buy a regular XBOX. So I thought about one of those WWII games that all seem so fun and cool. But who wants to learn history while they play games. I certainly don&rsquo;t. Then Sarah and I watch Major League 1 &amp; 2, which got me thinking, why not a baseball game. I mean aside from the fact that they are lame and all that which goes with the lameness. Or should I just wait until the Nintendo Revolution comes out and get one of those. I would get a PS3 when they come out but do to SonyÃ¯Â¿Â½s insanity they are talking like $800 for just the console. Maybe instead of that you could get to XBOX 360&rsquo;s and give one to me. hint hint. I mean if I was going to drop $800 on a system I would buy two systems or all of the systems that have been made previously. I mean WTF.</p>\n<p>There are just too many choices.</p>\n<p>That is all</p>\n<p>Oh and <a href=\"http://www.photodork.org\">this</a></p>\n<p>Just kidding there are actually four or more things.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>I am currently reading Verner VingeÃ¯Â¿Â½s other book wit Pham Nuwen in it. A Fire Upon the Deep it be called. The book has a really interesting concept of pack minds of the wolf-like Tines as the humans stranded on the planet calls them. I am not sure whether it take place before or after A deepness in the Sky or if that is the right whether.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ok that was the end</p>\n",

They traded out my SIM card and my service did not improve so I called back.\n\nOn my second call I got a man who we will call Asshole McGee (because that is what I thought he said his name wasÃ¯Â¿Â½can't be sure though). I explained my problem to him again, because even though they say they are noting it on your account, they are not, and he said that my only option was to send him $120 dollars for a new bottom of the line phone. Now by send I mean give him a credit card. What I did then was point out that I can cancel my service with Cingular Wireless for $150 then sign on with another carrier keeping my number and getting a free razr phone for just the $36 activation fee. So for just $66 more I can get a top of the line phone.\n\nHe was all like \"So you want to cancel your service?\" And I was all \"Not really I just don't want to get screwed by you guys.\" and he was all Ã¯Â¿Â½You got screwed by us when you signed your contract.\" And I was all \"whatever.\"\n\nSo that is that.\n\n3) XBOX 360,So I might get an Xbox 360. I am so excited. Not only can I play games on it but it will also turn into out new DVD player since we are currently using the PS@ with a wired controller to do all of the DVD watching.\n\nI am in a panic because I don't know what game to get, or which bundle to get or anything I am like a chicken who lost its head while crossing the road. Today I thought that the best thing to do would be to get the GTA three pack, however that was for the regular XBOX so if I was going to do that why not just buy a regular XBOX. So I thought about one of those WWII games that all seem so fun and cool. But who wants to learn history while they play games. I certainly don't. Then Sarah and I watch Major League 1 & 2, which got me thinking, why not a baseball game. I mean aside from the fact that they are lame and all that which goes with the lameness. Or should I just wait until the Nintendo Revolution comes out and get one of those. I would get a PS3 when they come out but do to SonyÃ¯Â¿Â½s insanity they are talking like $800 for just the console. Maybe instead of that you could get to XBOX 360's and give one to me. hint hint. I mean if I was going to drop $800 on a system I would buy two systems or all of the systems that have been made previously. I mean WTF.\n\nThere are just too many choices.\n\nThat is all\n\nOh and [this][1]\n\n   [1]: http://www.photodork.org\n\nJust kidding there are actually four or more things.\n\n4) I am currently reading Verner VingeÃ¯Â¿Â½s other book wit Pham Nuwen in it. A Fire Upon the Deep it be called. The book has a really interesting concept of pack minds of the wolf-like Tines as the humans stranded on the planet calls them. I am not sure whether it take place before or after A deepness in the Sky or if that is the right whether.\n\nOk that was the end\n",

Ladies if you have long hair, you might have a hard time with a wig but you might be able to just but your hair in pigtails poke some holes in a hat and have your look.

We left on wednesday night and drove to Grand Junction where we slept in the car for about 2 hours or so and then continued on. The funny thing about that is that we only had one pillow and one blanket so Sarah took the blanket and I the pillow. It was silly. I did sleep abnormally good for the small space and sleeping in car seats. After a quick breakfast of Burger King (which later seemed like less of a good idea then it did at the time,) we continued our journey with Sarah taking the first two hours of thursday. While Sarah drove us along I once again slept in the car seat this time with the pillow and blanket. After a brief rest stop we continued further into Utah, which is boring.</p>\n<p>We drove switching drivers every now and then and finally made it to Vegas. We got to our hotel and got ready to go to Mamma Mia at Mandalay Bay. At this point on Thursday it seems that we forgot that we had brought our own car. We stayed at the Stratosphere which is on the opposite side of the strip from where we needed to be. We had heard or read somewhere about the Las Vegas Tram that travels the strip and arrives at its stops about every 15 mins. Lies, all of it. We tried to ride the tram to our show but when we arrived at one of the stops there where other people wo had been waiting 30 mins and it had never shown up. So we got in a cab with a scary man. The cabs in Vegas are just sketchy, that is all there is to it. We got screwed on the fair and didn&rsquo;t tip the dude cause he was a frickin maniac. We got to the show and enjoyed it quite a bit. It is very fun and anyone who gets a chance should see it. after the show we where quite tired and decided to just wait for the tram rather then get screwed by another taxi. Magically one showed up about 10 minutes after we started waiting. However it took about 1 1\\2 hours to get back to our hotel.</p>\n<p>The next morning we woke up about 8am and headed off to explore Vegas. This time we just drove our own car and parked it at a central casino (the Belligio, I think) and walked. We walked alot. By the end of the day both of us where beat. We explored all of the major casinos (favorite was New York- New York) and didn&rsquo;t win any free cars. We did get to see some great art in an impressionist exhibit at one of the casinos and had generally a good time.</p>\n<p>On Saturday we got up and ate some breakfast and then headed to Mandalay Bay to see the Sharks.(oh yeah). They have the only predetor based aquarium or something like that. It was pretty impressive. That night we wnet to see &ldquo;O&rdquo;. It was so awesome as Sarah said in her post she practically had to drag me away afterwards I loved it so much. The stunts where crazy and the clowns where out of control.

I get down there and my mom comes steaming into the room and asks \"who is going to give me a ride to the (whatever)? I said I didn't know cause I had just messed up both of my ankles. so, she went back upstairs and like 5 minutes later came back down to make sure i was ok and to apologize for being crazy. she might deny it but it is all true.\n\nsorry mom  \ndylan\n",

Harper getting hurt made me think about all the time that I have hurt myself.</p>\n<p>There are many funny stories about how I have hurt my self and I am planning on sharing a few.</p>\n<p>Here is the Elbow Story<br>\nIt was the day of the all star clown show, I had just spent the last week perfecting my clown makeup and getting a new costume. I had also been working with Bob on a boxing gag. Bob was probably six foot something and more then three hundred pounds. A big man compared to my five nine one twenty five self. The gag went flawlessly with the champ (Bob) being beaten by the wimpy challenger (me). Then the show was over.<br>\nAfter the show while other clowns where signing autographs I was running about juggling. Thata€™s when it happened. I was running in my size seventeen clown shoes while juggling three clubs when I tripped. As I tried to catch myself my left elbow bent backwards and became dislocated. Dona€™t ever do that it is not fun. So there I was on my back, with my elbow bent all funny with a bunch of screaming kids saying do that again that was funny. I finally recognized one of the teachera€™s kids and sent them for help. When Dale Bothum got to me he asked if my elbow normally did things like this or if he needed to call and ambulance. I asked for the ambulance.<br>\nLucky for me the ambulance drivers in Minnesota have a sense of humor. The ambulance pulls up near me and out jump the paramedics. They bring over the backboard and start to place me on it. The funniest one asks me how I am feeling checks my capillary reflex all that paramedic stuff and then asks me if I was clowning around when I got hurt. HA HA. They loaded me onto the ambulance and took me off to the hospital.<br>\nAs we were riding to the hospital they wanted to put an oxygen mask on me so that I could breathe easier not go into shock or whatever. The problem was that my clown nose was still on and they couldna€™t get it off. They where pulling all nice and finally I just reached up and yanked it off. Once the oxygen mask was applied I just laid there on my back waiting to arrive at the hospital and wishing that there was a poster or something to read n the ceiling on the ambulance. I asked why there wasna€™t twice.<br>\nUpon arriving at the hospital they transferred me to a proper hospital gurney and tried to remove the oxygen mask. I say try because it had bonded to what was left of the nose glue on my nose. So once again I had to rip it off. At that point they gave me a conscious sedative to calm me down and take away y the pain. Shortly after that in my drugged up time frame they took me to the x-ray room to be x-rayed. The lady in the x-ray room found the fact that a clown was in here x-ray room to be hilarious and after taking my x-ray posed for a picture with me.<br>\nOnce the doctor saw my x ray he explained to me that I was lucky in that I hand a€˜t broken any bones in my elbow but I had dislocated it the hard way, straight back. She then said that she was going to need to give me morphine but I was not mentally able to sign the consent form because of the previous drug they gave me and I needed to pick someone to be a guardian for me. I pick someone at random first and the doctor suggested that I should pick someone I knew. So I chose Joe Barney aka Doc Geezer, one of the teachers at camp. He signed the consent and it was off into crazy land. The morphine hit me like a ton of bricks making all the pain go away and making me crazy.<br>\nWhile they where waiting for the drug to take affect I was left to my on devices. Those devices just happened to be show tunes. I dona€™t know why but I started singing the phantom of the opera with different voices for every character. They politely told me that I needed to be quiet because I was waking up other patients in the E.R. After about five minutes of show tunes they came in and re located my elbow. Talk about a POP! It was disgusting.<br>\nAfter that they took me to a room where a nice nurse helped me remove my clown makeup and get into a bed where I slept until morning. The next day I flew home and started physical therapy and my first semester at college. About two weeks after coming home I started to do gymnastics again and was soon back up to my old tricks.</p>\n",

First off on Sunday Sarah&rsquo;s PT Cruiser decided that is didn&rsquo;t really need to shift anymore. It decided this why we were going about 60mph on the highway. So we pulled over and stopped the car. I got out and took a look at the engine. Cuase that help, cause I have looked at a lot of engines in the past and automatically know what is wrong. we determine that it is broken and try to find a roadside assitance number. We search and search the car thinking hey this car is less then three years old it should still be covered under the warrenty. (not true but more on that later) So with no roadside assistance we call parents. Mine don&rsquo;t answer, Sarah&rsquo;s Dad is on a cruise, luckily Sarah&rsquo;s mom answers and sarah talks to her about what went on with the car. Right after sarah gets off the phone a nice man stops and gives us a ride home.(sarah admitted later that she was sure this nice man was going to kill us for sure.) Once we were home i was able to find the roadside assitance number online which helped with me out since i have all sort of internet in sarah&rsquo;s car. As I was talking to the roadside assitance people it came out that the warrenty had actually expired due to number of miles on the car. So we sat contemplating what to do, suddenly the phone rings and it is Bill sarah&rsquo;s step father. He said that he would meet us at the car and that we should pick up some transmission fluid on are way. WE piled into my car and drove to wal mart cause though we hate them they do have everything (or do they). We get into wal-mart and wonder over to the automotive section and search and search and cannot find transmission fluid. we ask one of the super helpful sales associates. he directs us over to the transmission fluid and we still cannot find the right stuff. So we ask again this time for the specific type of fluid. I even asked if he could check if they really have the right stuff. He was kind enough to once again refer us to the automotive section, where we just were so that helped. we then went to sears. they didn&rsquo;t have it so we ended up going to advanced auto parts and find stuff that would work.</p>\n<p>to be continued later&hellip;&hellip;</p>\n",

From what little i have gotten to talk to her i think that she is having a fun time. I have been having an ok time at home alone. I am sad that she is gone and cannot waituntil she gets home.<br>\nWhile she was gone I discoverd something wuite interesting about myself. I need human contact. without it i am sad. the worst part is that when sarah is out of ton i have no contact at home. I have no one to call when I gfet home and with idy being bus with school and such i was never sure if i would come hometo an empty house.<br>\nMy parents have also been out of town visiting my aunt as she graduates with a masters in divinity from a school in iowa. they are gone again this weekend to chicago where hiromi, harpers roomate, graduates with a masters in art history from chicago institurte of art. good job both of you. On a lighter note harper has sent me a package from somewhere not india but somewhaere else. he won&rsquo;t tell me what it is onlythat it is awesome. I can hardly wait.

From what little i have gotten to talk to her i think that she is having a fun time. I have been having an ok time at home alone. I am sad that she is gone and cannot waituntil she gets home.  \nWhile she was gone I discoverd something wuite interesting about myself. I need human contact. without it i am sad. the worst part is that when sarah is out of ton i have no contact at home. I have no one to call when I gfet home and with idy being bus with school and such i was never sure if i would come hometo an empty house.  \nMy parents have also been out of town visiting my aunt as she graduates with a masters in divinity from a school in iowa. they are gone again this weekend to chicago where hiromi, harpers roomate, graduates with a masters in art history from chicago institurte of art. good job both of you.

				"content_html": "<p>So I am sad today. A dog that I grew up with died to day. We found out Friday that she was going through renal failure. Her levels were off of the chart and yet she was not showing any pain the only way you knew that anything was wrong was that she was lethargic and wouldn&rsquo;t eat regularly. After getting her test results back the vet said that he was surprise at how well she was doing.<br>\nLucy was a cocker spaniel mix that we got when I was seven years old. She was a light tan color and had brown eyes. She was a neurotic licker that if given the chance would lick you until you couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. One of my favorite memories of Lucy was when I was eight or nine. I had been training Lucy in obedience through 4-H. I had just reached the level were she was supposed to be walked off leash. I was at the fair showing Lucy and my dad had just gotten there to watch when suddenly Lucy spots him or smells him and bolts. She runs to him, jumps in his arms and is just as happy as a clam.<br>\nWhen I got to the house this morning Lucy was asleep between the couch and one of the armchairs in the living room. I reached down to pet her and she didn&rsquo;t move. After a brief moment of panic I noticed that her chest is moving, so I sit beside her and read <em>Readers Digest</em>. After a while she struggles to her feet and wobbles to the laundry room.

				"content_text": "\nSo I am sad today. A dog that I grew up with died to day. We found out Friday that she was going through renal failure. Her levels were off of the chart and yet she was not showing any pain the only way you knew that anything was wrong was that she was lethargic and wouldn't eat regularly. After getting her test results back the vet said that he was surprise at how well she was doing.  \nLucy was a cocker spaniel mix that we got when I was seven years old. She was a light tan color and had brown eyes. She was a neurotic licker that if given the chance would lick you until you couldn't take it anymore. One of my favorite memories of Lucy was when I was eight or nine. I had been training Lucy in obedience through 4-H. I had just reached the level were she was supposed to be walked off leash. I was at the fair showing Lucy and my dad had just gotten there to watch when suddenly Lucy spots him or smells him and bolts. She runs to him, jumps in his arms and is just as happy as a clam.  \nWhen I got to the house this morning Lucy was asleep between the couch and one of the armchairs in the living room. I reached down to pet her and she didn't move. After a brief moment of panic I noticed that her chest is moving, so I sit beside her and read _Readers Digest_. After a while she struggles to her feet and wobbles to the laundry room. I follow her, hoping to get a chance to pet her; when we arrive in the laundry room she walks to her water bowl (which happened to be empty) and then gives me a dirty look. I refill her bowl and then stand back as she takes a few tentative drinks. She soon decides that it is water and starts lapping it up as if it is the best drink ever. After a few minutes she loses interest in the water and wonders outside. I watch as she wonders listlessly around the yard. Her back legs shake as she walks around the yard from tree to tree.  \nWhen Lucy was a puppy she was as cute as any puppy could be. The funny thing about Lucy was that she was deathly afraid of Harper and I's babysitter Amy. The thing with Amy is that she hates dogs. (Or so she says). Anytime she would say Lucy's name Lucy would roll over on her back and submit.  \nAround 10:45am my dad came home to take Lucy to the vet. There are three images today that will stick with me forever. One of them was when my dad was holding Lucy on his lap, sitting on the couch, and removing Lucy's collar for the last time.

Please don&rsquo;t. You will <strong>DIE</strong>. The reason you don&rsquo;t need to worry while swimming is that your lungs don&rsquo;t gain any air as you descend. Due to water pressure the air in your lungs actually compresses. So at 5 feet seawater (FSW) the air in your lungs is essentialy cut in half.

Therefore when you stand up you will double the amount of air in you lungs and pop them. So thats fun.<br>\nThe problem is not the popped lung(s), you will still be able to breathe, the problem is that one of two things happenend. One, that air has escaped into you cheast cavity causing what is known as the crackles. This is a crackling sensation felt under you skin. This will make you feel itchy and also cause a deformed look in your neck and shoulders. Two, air gets into you lungs travels to your heart and then to your brain. This essentially causes a stroke.<br>\nThe biggest problem with AGEs is that it gets worse as you go up and it is immediate.

All Harper and his friends could talk about was how incredibly big it was. From the airport we went to harpers apartment to wait for <a href=\"http://nata2.info/pictures/Incoming/matiss.gif\">Matisse</a> to get home. When he arrived we went to go get Diabolo Brad. Diabolo Brad is known to me now as CIgar Box Brad. After picking up Brad we finally headed to Madison. We got there late checked into our hotel and went to sleep. We woke up around nine in the morning and headed to MadFest. It was a spactacular amount of fun. We passed and juggled and such all day. I unicycled and scraped\\smashed the heck out of my shin. It was all sorts of bloody. Now it is all sorts of scabby. That night we went to the big show. We saw alot of good jugglers: Matt Henry, Jack Kalvin. We also saw George Orange on slack rope. Possibly the strangest act was a man by the name of Marcus Monroe. Now Marcus is a pretty good juggler and such but his whole presentation was very sporadic. He went from juggling to beat boxing to dancing to stand up. it wsa quite weird. For his finale he juggle to balls and a chainsaw. Needless to say he overrotated one of the chainsaws and cut up his arm. Sweet. On Sunday we went back to MadFest and that was when I learned all sorts of new stuff. i learned to thunder shower six clubs and also to pass back to back. In the afternoon I helped some people with unicycling and then I learned to do cigar box tricks. This was when Diabolo Brad became Cigar Box Brad. I am now a huge fan of cigar box manipulation.

				"content_html": "<p>Here I sit in the last row of the airplane. Lucky row 13, seat B. It rules. I am on a plane that seats 50 people. On entrance in front as well as exits on the wings. I am sitting next to a lady who not only is she rude but she kind of smells like an apartment building. Not dirty but not necessarily clean either. The other 12 rows are 4 seats, two on each side of the aisle, not lucky 13 though. We get to sit by ourselves and suffer. Instead of two seats across from me there is the only bathroom for these 50 people. So maybe the lady next to me doesn&rsquo;t smell of old apartments maybe it is the smell of disinfectant and the piss stench that disinfectants cannot cover.</p>\n<p>I arrived at the airport with about 1.5 hours before take off and went and sat by security waiting for the privilege of security people. What fun. The lady at the counter were I had gotten my boarding pass told me to go to the security area a little before 5pm for my flight at 5:30. So I get up there at like 4:15 and sit and relax with Sarah and her family. Around 4:45 Sarah and I go stand in line so I can go through security. At 4:47 they start boarding my plane and then at 4:56 they call a last call for all passengers on flight whatever to Chicago. Excuse me. I hadn&rsquo;t even been in line long enough to have to think about taking my laptop out of my bag. I mention this to the security agent who gives me a tough shit sneer and explains that its not his fault that I didn&rsquo;t get to the airport soon enough. Suddenly a roar starts behind me almost every other person in line ahead and behind me is in the same dilemma. Weird. As you may have guessed I got on the plane fine and am on my way to Chi town to board another plane to Denver. Hope mom and dad pick me up.</p>\n<p>Back to the restroom seat. One of the officers (pilot co-pilot or navigator) just came to use the restroom. WTF. All this shit I have heard about better security and locked doors to the cockpit and he just walks back here. And the look he gave me before shutting the door. You know the bastard is gonna take a huge stinky dump. Bastard. Well he is out now and that seems to be the case. I find it funny that the pilot just got up and walked back here to go to the bathroom. I sure hope he was the pilot. At least I saw him go in so I know he didn&rsquo;t go change and is going to crash us that would suck.</p>\n<p>In Vt I went to the Ben and Jerry&rsquo;s factory and Al&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.alsfrenchfries.com\">french fries.</a> Al&rsquo;s has the best french fries I have ever had. It has been open since 1948 I believe and is a popular haunt for the kids. Well I don&rsquo;t really know that but it might be. I would certainly go there if I was a kid. Oh yeah, happy new year. Sorry I forgot sitting near the poop hole will do that for you. I hung out at Sarah&rsquo;s aunt Carol&rsquo;s house and it was Sarah&rsquo;s mom&rsquo;s birthday. She is 50 (don&rsquo;t tell anyone). It was quite a party and all of Sarah&rsquo;s family is really nice and fun to hang out with. She has an abnormal number of girl cousins. Like 15 or something like that. OK its really only eight but that still a lot since almost all of my family is male. Its weird.</p>\n<p>Sarah and I get married this year in about eight months from Sunday. 09\\04\\04 is the date if you haven&rsquo;t gotten an invitation your not invited. OK i&rsquo;ll admit it we haven&rsquo;t sent them but we will. But are you on that list??? who knows. It should be fun to get married. I am nervous and excited like opening presents excited. Unless that present is from Harper in which case you know what the present is because Harper is just that slick.</p>\n<p>On a sad note on of my friends fathers died and that makes me sad. It is tragic and my heart goes out to the Knutsons. Keefe I know you probably won&rsquo;t read this but if you need me call. I&rsquo;ll call you tomorrow. Sorry I haven&rsquo;t called yet.</p>\n<p>TO BE CONTINUED&hellip;</p>\n<p>Alright, now I am on my plane to Denver. A short while ago I was in Chicago. When we landed at O&rsquo;hare the pilot came on the intercom and said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but there has been some plane problems at the gate and so we will not be at the gate for another twenty minutes&rdquo; The time was 6:40, my plane to Denver boarded at 7:00 and departed at 7:40. So I called Harper and told him that he might be taking me to sushi tonight. Then at 7:00 we finally arrived at the gate and then the fun started. My plane from Vt landed at the A concourse I believe and my flight to Denver left from gate C 11 way over in C concourse. Its like a mile walk or so. Maybe more I don&rsquo;t know. 7:00 at gate, 7:10 off plane since I was in the back row. That meant that I had 30 minutes to get to my gate. Really 10 or so since they say they want you at the gate 20 minutes ahead or so. Add to this the fact that I brought my laptop on this trip so Sarah could music up her ipod. So I was running heavy coat in hand, computer strapped to my back listening to &ldquo;I wanna have some fun&rdquo; on my ipod. Thank god for dance vol.1. As I ran I realized that escalators and moving sidewalks would be perilous to me getting to the gate on time. I ran quickly through concourse A following signs to concourse C. As I progressed further I started to get a little tired. Then I saw a set of stairs going sown to the next part. At this point the song was now &ldquo;good times&rdquo; from the dance CD. I shot down the stairs darting in and out of people as if I was on skis. I almost knocked on person over but I quickly said sorry and continued on. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs I looked hopefully ahead of me and I was in the light tunnel thing at O&rsquo;hare. Oh Joy. I quickly sprinted along the shiny tile floor and failed to notice the pattern of the neon lights that so fascinated me last time I came into O&rsquo;hare and walked through them. I shot up to the right of the moving sidewalks and just kept running as I reached the other ends staircase the song switched to &ldquo;this is your night&rdquo; and I was dying. I actually rode this escalator up. Upon reaching the top I continued on and was happy to see that I was finally close to concourse B. Turning what I hoped was the final corner I found my self in concourse B near gate be one looking up at a sign that said GATES B1-B36 and it also said CONCOURSE C. I had to run all the way through concourse B to get to Concourse C. Bad airport designers. Finally I made it to my plane.</p>\n<p>Just so everyone knows I used spell check on this entry.</p>\n<p>Back to the Tragedy. It is disturbing to me that apparently me and my friends my age have reached the age that we realize our parents are mortals. I know that I said something like that when my dad was having his surgery but it seems to be a common theme in my life and the life of my peers. While I was visiting Vt I noticed that I Noticed that people my parents age seemed less invincible. You know you are a kid and your parents and grownups in general are iTherenvincible you never think of them as being able to die. There may be the odd grownup here and there but never such a number. Maybe I am being morbid but I am scared for my parents as well as for all people my parents age and such.</p>\n<p>On this plane I am sitting in the middle of a really big big plane it is about 10 rows of 6 first class seats and 31 rows of 7 economy plus or whatever they call them . The cabin I am in is 2 seats at each window separate by an aisle then 3 seats then aisle and then 2 more window seats. I am in row 38 out of 41 and I am in the middle all by myself. I have all the room I want and find myself to be very comfortable which I feel I deserve seeing as how I had to run a really long way. On the 7th of Jan. I am pretty sure Sarah and I will have been together for 4 years ( if I am wrong then it is 5 but it doesn&rsquo;t seem like that could possible. In march we will have been engaged for a year and we will be married. I am now open to suggestions for what Sarah and I should do for our honeymoon. Right now I am thinking of fourThey possibilities.</p>\n<p>Option 1: Disneyworld-&gt; Home of everything fun. They have honeymoon packages that include just about everything and provide fun things to do such as a spa day and dinner with mickey and minnie.</p>\n<p>Option 2: Bed and Breakfast in Vermont-&gt; High on the romance factor. Locked away in a B&amp;B in Vermont maybe up in Stowe area. A plus to this idea is that we could have a second reception for Sarah&rsquo;s relatives in Vermont.</p>\n<p>Option 3: Italy\\europe-&gt; The winner in romance I think plus it would give Sarah and I a chance to check out a lot of the art that Sarah loves and also to go to a totally different place.</p>\n<p>Option 4: Cruise-&gt; Why not. Tropical probably nice and relaxing. Just hang out on the boat and be lazy. All inclusive so little other expense.</p>\n<p>If you have an opinion email me at <a href=\"mailto:honeymoon@ballooons.com\">honeymoon@ballooons.com</a> and I&rsquo;ll tally the results and let everyone know.</p>\n<p>While I was in Vermont I read the DaVinci Code. It was real good. I know a lot of people agree and this is what I thought. The plot was really good and engrossing as were the characters. I felt like I could identify with the detective. I think that the most enjoyable part of it was the descriptions of the art as well as the lore and myth that it discussed. I am wanting to learn more about the Rose and all of the secret societies that were talked about.</p>\n<p>Also while I was in Vermont I watched Mona Lisa Smile. It was fairly good. When I saw the previews for it I pegged as a dead poets society for girls. I was just about right. Rather then ending tragically and leaving you sad it left you quite happy and you wanted to follow the main girls to the future. Julia Roberts did a good job and once again I was fascinated by the art that was shown. I think Sarah has had a positive influence on me. I love art history and maybe I should take a class.</p>\n<p>speaking of classes this next semester I am taking intro to environmental studies, physical geography, and history after 1877. Physical geography is a funny one because it has a lab. I think that means that my teacher will teach us about hills and then on lab days the class will go outside and the professor will say that over there is a hill. OK it will probably be harder then that but maybe not.</p>\n<p>I love Sarah.</p>\n<p>dylan</p>\n<p><strong>A</strong>_R__G_H!</p>\n",

Maybe more I don't know. 7:00 at gate, 7:10 off plane since I was in the back row. That meant that I had 30 minutes to get to my gate. Really 10 or so since they say they want you at the gate 20 minutes ahead or so. Add to this the fact that I brought my laptop on this trip so Sarah could music up her ipod. So I was running heavy coat in hand, computer strapped to my back listening to \"I wanna have some fun\" on my ipod. Thank god for dance vol.1. As I ran I realized that escalators and moving sidewalks would be perilous to me getting to the gate on time. I ran quickly through concourse A following signs to concourse C. As I progressed further I started to get a little tired. Then I saw a set of stairs going sown to the next part. At this point the song was now \"good times\" from the dance CD. I shot down the stairs darting in and out of people as if I was on skis. I almost knocked on person over but I quickly said sorry and continued on. Upon reaching the bottom of the stairs I looked hopefully ahead of me and I was in the light tunnel thing at O'hare. Oh Joy. I quickly sprinted along the shiny tile floor and failed to notice the pattern of the neon lights that so fascinated me last time I came into O'hare and walked through them. I shot up to the right of the moving sidewalks and just kept running as I reached the other ends staircase the song switched to \"this is your night\" and I was dying. I actually rode this escalator up. Upon reaching the top I continued on and was happy to see that I was finally close to concourse B. Turning what I hoped was the final corner I found my self in concourse B near gate be one looking up at a sign that said GATES B1-B36 and it also said CONCOURSE C. I had to run all the way through concourse B to get to Concourse C. Bad airport designers. Finally I made it to my plane.\n\nJust so everyone knows I used spell check on this entry.\n\nBack to the Tragedy. It is disturbing to me that apparently me and my friends my age have reached the age that we realize our parents are mortals. I know that I said something like that when my dad was having his surgery but it seems to be a common theme in my life and the life of my peers. While I was visiting Vt I noticed that I Noticed that people my parents age seemed less invincible. You know you are a kid and your parents and grownups in general are iTherenvincible you never think of them as being able to die. There may be the odd grownup here and there but never such a number. Maybe I am being morbid but I am scared for my parents as well as for all people my parents age and such. \n\nOn this plane I am sitting in the middle of a really big big plane it is about 10 rows of 6 first class seats and 31 rows of 7 economy plus or whatever they call them . The cabin I am in is 2 seats at each window separate by an aisle then 3 seats then aisle and then 2 more window seats. I am in row 38 out of 41 and I am in the middle all by myself. I have all the room I want and find myself to be very comfortable which I feel I deserve seeing as how I had to run a really long way. On the 7th of Jan. I am pretty sure Sarah and I will have been together for 4 years ( if I am wrong then it is 5 but it doesn't seem like that could possible. In march we will have been engaged for a year and we will be married. I am now open to suggestions for what Sarah and I should do for our honeymoon. Right now I am thinking of fourThey possibilities. \n\nOption 1: Disneyworld-> Home of everything fun. They have honeymoon packages that include just about everything and provide fun things to do such as a spa day and dinner with mickey and minnie. \n\nOption 2: Bed and Breakfast in Vermont-> High on the romance factor. Locked away in a B&B in Vermont maybe up in Stowe area. A plus to this idea is that we could have a second reception for Sarah's relatives in Vermont.\n\nOption 3: Italy\\europe-> The winner in romance I think plus it would give Sarah and I a chance to check out a lot of the art that Sarah loves and also to go to a totally different place. \n\nOption 4: Cruise-> Why not. Tropical probably nice and relaxing. Just hang out on the boat and be lazy. All inclusive so little other expense.\n\nIf you have an opinion email me at honeymoon@ballooons.com and I'll tally the results and let everyone know.\n\nWhile I was in Vermont I read the DaVinci Code. It was real good. I know a lot of people agree and this is what I thought. The plot was really good and engrossing as were the characters. I felt like I could identify with the detective. I think that the most enjoyable part of it was the descriptions of the art as well as the lore and myth that it discussed. I am wanting to learn more about the Rose and all of the secret societies that were talked about. \n\nAlso while I was in Vermont I watched Mona Lisa Smile. It was fairly good. When I saw the previews for it I pegged as a dead poets society for girls. I was just about right. Rather then ending tragically and leaving you sad it left you quite happy and you wanted to follow the main girls to the future. Julia Roberts did a good job and once again I was fascinated by the art that was shown. I think Sarah has had a positive influence on me. I love art history and maybe I should take a class. \n\nspeaking of classes this next semester I am taking intro to environmental studies, physical geography, and history after 1877. Physical geography is a funny one because it has a lab. I think that means that my teacher will teach us about hills and then on lab days the class will go outside and the professor will say that over there is a hill. OK it will probably be harder then that but maybe not. \n\nI love Sarah.\n\ndylan\n\n**A**_R__G_H!\n",

I hope to be able to put together a good show to present to b-day parties and also to do on stage. I am going to start a non-profit organization that will bring entertainers from other states to do presentations for rural schools and communities as well as hold juggling workshops. i think it will rock. the only problem is setting up non-profit status and then getting donations.

I don&rsquo;t really know how all that will work yet but hope to bring <a href=\"http://www.markhayward.net\">mark</a> to colorado first as well as <a href=\"http://www.thejugglers.org/\">the jugglers</a>. i will then contact other entertainers so i can bring them to colorado and possibly wyoming.

				"content_html": "<p>So last night rocked. I mean it, it rocked. Around 8 o&rsquo;clock Thomas (the cat) decided to escape. Well actually when Idy got home last night the door didn&rsquo;t latch entirely in the garage. This normally wouldn&rsquo;t be that big of deal, however, last night the garage door didn&rsquo;t get shut and the wind blew the door open. So there I was minding my own business when I hear &ldquo;Fuck!! Has anyone seen Thomas and Vegas?&rdquo; So the search begins. Vegas was easy to find because he is a wimp and just hides under the car in the garage. Thomas on the other hand is a lot bolder and was gone like a flash. Sarah searched the house for about 15 minutes while Idy and I ran around like crazy people through the area right by our house. We then broadened are search to include the surrounding blocks. After about one and a half hours of seeking with no finding. Idy spotted him from her car and called us. Sarah and I, being near the house, hoped into her care and raced, not unlike police, to the scene. Idy had spotted Thomas sitting under a tree and once she got out of her car he was gone. We searched frantically around this area. The area we were searching was a hill that the developers probably put up to block the sound of interstate 25. It was incredibly steep and treacherous. After searching and searching, we decided to drive around shining a flashlight in between houses. Sarah and I were in her car and Idy had driven back to the house to pick up Tony. Suddenly Sarah spotted him between two houses and I stopped the car. We slowly exited the vehicle and approached the cat. Surprise, surprise the little bastard runs. We gave chase but he is a cat on four legs and he left us in the dust. Sarah and I got back in the car and started driving back and forth on the same street. Sarah&rsquo;s cell phone started to ring about 15 minutes later. It was Idy calling saying that they had found him and had him cornered. We hurried to were they had him trapped and the four of us surrounded him. We approached slowly and then like a star football player he jumped and juked and sprinted a way. We chased him, me in the lead and Tony not far behind when suddenly he pulled a kitty disappearing act. Just like that he was gone. I couldn&rsquo;t understand how that could happen. At this point it was 11 o&rsquo;clock and Sarah and I hadn&rsquo;t eaten dinner so we all headed back to the house to rest. The hope was that Thomas would just come home. After I had two pop-tarts and Sarah had some popcorn we headed back out on the road. After about 10 minutes of searching I spotted him at a corner house. I had the flashlight beam on him and I slowly removed my cell phone from my pocket and called Idy. Before Idy could answer Thomas started to run so I tossed the cell phone on my seat and sprinted after him. He stopped under a car and yowled at us. Sarah approached slowly and almost got him before he bolted around the house and around the corner. I take off like a greyhound and keep up with him. Now the house we were running around has a fence on the sides and the front but not in the back. Thomas runs around the side fence and into the backyard with me in hot pursuit. He ran to the corner and climbed the fence. Then before I knew it I was climbing the fence Jackie Chan style and continuing pursuit like I was on COPS. He runs around and goes under the same car he was under before. As we approached the car he ran again and again I chased him. This time when he got to the end of the side fence he just disappeared. I couldn?t find him. I started to cuss&hellip;a lot. I was furious, I had splinters in my hand from climbing the fence, and all I wanted was my damn cat. Sarah came over, out of breath because this whole time she had also been running and I told her that I had lost him again. I looked around one more time before heading back to the car. As I finished turning I saw the flash of green eyes. It had to be him. I told Sarah I had found him as I walked over. He has situated himself under a <a href=\"http://www.jeep.com/grand_cherokee/index.html?context=homepage&amp;type=main\">Jeep Grand Cherokee</a> and looked pissed. Sarah and I kept him under there until Idy and Tony arrived and then we attacked. Sarah got him out and handed him to Idy and we whisked him home. At this point it was about 12:30 or so. I was tired it sucked in a fun sort of way.</p>\n",

Weird huh. So today in geography we spent 50 minutes covering everything about Montr?al. For example when Montr?al was first founded it was in a primary shipping lane. Montr?al Island had to stop and be carried over the island to the other side and put back into the St. Lawrence River to be carried to the Atlantic Ocean. However in the winter time ice flows down the Ottawa River from the north and clogs up the rapids forming a natural reservoir west of Montr?al. Then in the spring the ice melts and the island floods, all except Mount Royal (Montr?al), a small hill in the center of the island, which is were they founded the city. On a not so fun note we have a cat that pees in one corner of the laundry room and another cat that has anal leakage problems. Seriously it sucks a lot. I have gotten 96% on both my math and geography tests. So I rock. Sarah has been working on a photo project that involves using a 4x5 view camera. To understand what a view camera is picture an old fashion camera. You know the kind with bellows. Weighs like 400 lbs. ok not really 400lbs. like 20 maybe 30. Sarah and I might be getting trogdor shirts.<br>\nSo that?s all I love everyone and Sarah<br>\nlove Dylan</p>\n",

I am slowly getting better but it is an uphill battle. At the beginning of my schooling this summer my English teacher told my class to use the writing center for help. She suggested that we go into the writing center and tell the people there what they needed to look for. I went in with my last paper, Cheese Please, and asked the guy there to look for comma splices. He found a couple and I was able to fix them before I went to class.

I learned how to do some new stuff on <a href=\"http://www.unicycling.org/unicycling/mounts/\">unicycles</a> such as two different kick up mounts the 180 mount the suicide mount and the on leg around mount. I also learned how to juggle ten clubs with Harper and matiss. Now that we are on the subject of juggling I will tell you why Harper sux. We were competing in the ten club-3 person endurance. It is something that I learned just that day. Harper is talking all this trash about if we lose I am walking home and then he drops in the first 30 seconds if that. Ok so he isn&rsquo;t really that crappy but maybe a little at least. Also there is the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/G/gayometer/gayometer.html\">gayness test</a> that everyone should take. I am 33% gay, Sarah is 30% and Idy is 36% gay. Harper is 46%gay. Boy is he gay. Hopefully soon I will have videos from juggle fest up (hint hint Harper). As soon as I do you can all watch me fall and hurt my self over and over again. I have decided that it would be nice to have a digital video camera so I can make videos of myself doing silly stuff. Anyone who wants to sponsor my video camera email me and I?ll stick a sticker with you name on it on my unicycle. Well thanks.

Vin Diesel is such a bad ass. I also saw Austin Powers 3 again. It was funny again. The way that they were able to spoof themselves was hilarious. Tonight I watched the movie the sweetest thing with Cameron Diaz. It is a pretty funny movie. I am enjoying school a lot. We are finishing up MT and PT this week and then next week we are going to start UT. I hope that everyone is well and good.

It is OK. At 1:00 or so we are going to get donuts and coffee at a donut shop by my house. yippee. I hope that we get done quickly tomarrow. I am enjoying school aside from the fact that i have to go to school so early that it messes with my head alot. In about 3 weeks i will be done getting up early and will start doing 8-5 school which will be nice. I am going to go into the NDT\\spec tech program. NDT is non-destructive testing. This is what you do to test welds and corrosion on metal and other materials. It is used everywhere from car manufacturers to brewerys. It sounds like it will be a good time and if it isn&rsquo;t i can quickly switch to the med tech program. I have been doing some thinking and i think that I need to get back on a normal sleep schedule, this isn&rsquo;t going to happen anytime soon because i work from 4pm-12am on fri and sat so that will mess me up again. I am tired and whiney. Did anyone like the pictures of my school?? it is the one without the swimming pool. I love you very much sarah and am very excited to marry you. i love you mom and dad. Scooter get well. love you harper. Hee Hee.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Hello. I had a fun week this last week. It all started Monday. I went to welding school. It was fun, I got to cut with an oxy- acetelyn torch (bring on the safes) and I got to work on my bead with 7018 rod. When I got home from welding I though it would be fun to play a little basketball. Randy (my roommate) and I played 4 games one on one. I won the last one. Then my other roommate Josh and my friend from school Waylon came out and we played Randy and I vs. Waylon and Josh. Randy and I won. Then a couple of High school students came out and we played 3v3. During this game I succeeded in rolling my right ankle. It sucked. I then soaked my ankle in the pool for 15min and then the hot tub for 15min for about 2 hours. The next day I got up and went to school. I explained to the MASTER DIVER that I had hurt my ankle so he sent me to the local free clinic to get an x-ray. 2 hours later I got to see a doctor. He looked at my ankle for about 5 seconds and then sent me back to the waiting room for 30 more minutes to wait for an x ray. After that he looked at my x ray said I was fine and sent me on my way. Since I couldn&rsquo;t drive I had gotten a ride from one of my classmates, which meant that I had to wait for my ride to come back and pick me up. That took another 45 min. When I got back to school I had to get in my wetsuit and in the water to make up for lost dive time. I did a dive in the band mask and did pneumo breathing. That means that your air is cut off and so you have to stuff your pneumo hose (a hose used to gauge depth using air pressure) in to your helmet. You say, ?Diver lost primary shoot the pneumo?. You then stuff it up into your helmet and breathe. After I did it on the band mask I had to surface and go straight to the superlite 17b. Oh did I mention that you have to pneumo breath on you r stomach on your back and upside-down. When you get upside down water rushes into your helmet, which sure is fun. I realize that this doesn?t sound to bad but just wait. On weds I just kind of chilled and let my footrest. On Thursday I went to school and we had to do what are called ditch and dons. This means that you go under water wearing a helmet and then take it off and put it back on three times in ten minutes. It is fun, really. I was the first person to go in on the superlite 17b. It kicked my butt. I couldn?t do it I was in the water for 10 min and I got it off three times and on two times, doh! The next helmet is the band mask; it is simple because it is a soft hat. You just rip it off and force it back on I did it in about 3 minutes. Then I moved to the miller. The miller is a big brass hat. It is heavy, as in 1\\5 of my body weight. (I might have exaggerated earlier when I said it weighed 60 but never mind.) It has a neoprene and brass neck dam. The helmet itself has two cams, one on each side, you have to align the neck dam and then cam it up. It is hard on the surface but is cake underwater. It took me 5 min. I then got to go back to the superlite and try it one more time. It took me 4 min this time. I then celebrated by doing a flip under water and yelling a lot. Thursday night I went home and went to sleep. I woke up late on Friday. That was my week. I got an A in my class and will remain on the dean?s list for another class. My next class will be the sat barge where class start at 2:30 am on Tuesday and 1:30 on Thursday Sweet. I had a lot of fun this week. I love you Sarah and Harper and mom and dad and everyone else. Peace out?. Heehee. Pictures to come.</p>\n",

I just thought that it was asleep and would be fine. It is still numb. I asked one of the medical people at my school and they said that i had probably just pinched a nerve and to give it about a week to get better. so if i still have a numb pinky on fri. off it comes i&rsquo;ll just hack it right off. Or i&rsquo;ll just go to the doctor. I hope it is okay. I have also started exerciseing regularly. I run or swim everyday. if i run i do it for about 30 mins and if i swim i swim about 10 laps. I also have been doing push ups and situps in hopes of becoming the next action hero in movies. heehee. that would be sweet. I was in downtown long beach today and they were blocking of a whole street and they had lights set up and cameras and dressing rooms. I can only assume they are filming a movie. so of course i pretended that i was with the company and tried to sneak on to the set. i didn&rsquo;t make it and I didn&rsquo;t even see anybody famous. sad day mr bill.

Delta P is a suction created by a having two or more bodies of water connected by a tube or pipe. When the bodies of water are of inequal depths then there is a suction force equal to the surface area of the hole times the difference in depth times .445 if sea water or .436 if fresh water.(.445 is the weight of 1 foot of sea water in pounds per square inch, .436 is&hellip; figure it out.) If your arm was to get sucked into a hole 10 inches in diameter and there was a depth difference of 50 FSW (feet sea water) getting your arm out would be equal to lifting up 1760 lbs with one hand. Thats like a subaru WRX. We watched a video on it and they had cool fottage of a Crab the size of my head being sucked into a crack the size of the scroll bar on the side of your screen. (&ndash;&gt;) It showed it getting stuck and then half was sucked in and then the rest was sucked in. Sweet. Sad but Sweet. Also this afternoon I got to do what is called a modified treatment table 6a (the school calls it the narc dive). This consists of going down to 165 FSW (see above) at 75fpm (Feet per minute). When you reach this depth breathing air the partial pressure of Nitrogen is increased about six times. This makes you drunk or narc&rsquo;d. This is because Nitrogen has an adverse affect on your nervous system in the same way that alchohal does. This is known as nitrogen narcosis. It is fun. We stayed down fo about 10 mins and I have never laughed harder in my life. When we are at the surface they make us do one of those puzzles were you put the shapes inside of the proper shaped hole. It took me 16 secs on the surface and 26 secs on the bottom. Anyway take notes quiz next post. I love you Sarah. bye everyone</p>\n",

My last class was called physics and physiology and it covered the dangers of commercial divers and the different kinds of barotrauma (trauma caused by great pressures). My teacher for that was Scott Cassell who is a crazy diver who I think is pretty cool. He dives and films dangerous animals and gets attacked by them. Sweet!! My teacher for Rigging is Scott Young. He is pretty cool, He is a pretty gruff old seaman. He has also done some pretty crazy stuff. I go to school on tues and thurs and work mon, weds and fri.
